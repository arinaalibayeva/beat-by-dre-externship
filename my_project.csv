R1JWJ95BYVWRD0,B0C2W1KLSS,"5.0 out of 5 stars An alternative to AirPod Pros? Yes, but with a slight lower quality difference. Worth it? Yes",Matthew Martínez,5,"I compared these beats with AirPod pros. Both are Apple products.The beats have a smaller range of volume, the lowest volume is pretty loud for the “lowest volume”. Each level for volume going up is minimal compared to the AirPods. (At around 1/3 of the volume they match volume. AirPods get a lot quieter and ALOT louder, I’d say 10% louder) The beats are loud enough for me I leave it at 3/4 of volume.Noise cancellation is really good, some noise filters through in loud environments but it’s enough when you’re at the gym and busy places. I experienced noise filtering through when I was in a car with music blasting. So I’d rate the noise cancellation pretty high.Pass through, pass through is good. I’d recommend not having the pass through when there’s lots of noise cause it’s good and personally it can get loud. When there’s a sudden loud noise the earbuds make the same loud noise and it could hurt your ears if you have sensitive hearing.Cons, when in loud environments if you are on a call the earbuds filter out the noise, and when you speak it filters your voice a bit too which makes it hard for the other person on the other end to hear you. Also the bit about the loud noise with the pass through and sensitive ears is a con for me.Battery life is really good, lasts me my work day and a bit more, I’m sure like all batteries that would go down after use but hasn’t happened to me yet I’ve had it for 2 months now.Bluetooth, the Bluetooth is pretty strong. You could probably still have a connection a few rooms away in a house before the connection begins to fail. Unlike AirPods when you remove the bud from an ear whatever is playing will not pause unless YOU pause it. This means it’s constantly connected, when you are within the Bluetooth radius of course. I’ve lost a bud twice but this actually helped me find it, so that’s a plus. And with these beats you cannot connect another pair to your phone like you can with AirPods. So it’s only on pair of beats at a time.I really like the earbuds and I think they are well worth the price, to me they are a barely lesser version of AirPod pros. I’m considering getting the studio pro’s over the AirPod max after this experience.Update 4 months later- The battery life is still very strong, I have had some issues with them disconnecting and reconnecting to my phone and I believe it’s because when I got my Apple Watch, it must be Confusing the connection between my phone and the watch. Yes, it can be annoying but to me, it’s still worth it. All really need to do is reconnect with my phone. I don’t think AirPods Will have this problem. But I’m not sure. There was one day where the noise cancellation on my right earbud stopped working, but it’s because I didn’t have enough battery so I had to charge it after that I had no issues.","Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2024",AFPNLCKHE6UN5JN6M77MOHLXXGGA,True,33,Color: IvoryStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+
R2BD35HL2C6JSK,B0C2W1KLSS,5.0 out of 5 stars Read this Review (I'll tell you why I settled on these after researching for months!),Tuck VB,5,"You're probably like me, dragging your feet for months, researching and researching for hours trying to compare brand names (Bose, or JBL? Sennheiser, or Apple?). I finally settled on these, and here's why:1) I didn't want airpods. You probably also don't want airpods (if you're even reading this review). Not because of the quality, but because ""everyone has airpods"" and they're ""airpod people"" (sorry to all the airpod people, including my sister). I wanted to be different (hopefully no shame there?).2) My top priority was phone calls with my earbuds (make sure, even if you don't end up with these earbuds, that you determine your priorities, -clearly-). These earbuds have some of the best ""in ear"" calling I've seen (next to airpods).3) I wanted something low profile (also why I didn't want airpods with the ""stem""). These are very sleek, and don't look flashy in the ear. They're also not very cumbersome, and fit very snuggly. Very light, but durable - great design, even better build quality.4) Not a huge selling factor for me personally, but if you want noise cancellation, this is your stop. I just used these this morning on the train coming into Boston, sitting next to the door leading out of the coach, and was astonished with how adaptive it was to specifically tuning out the rattling of the train. These earbuds will adapt to the environments around them!5) The battery life is fantastic. Keep in mind, if you're in a loud area with the noise cancelling on, and it's working harder, you're going to blow through your battery faster - even that considered, I was still really impressed with the battery life!6) This is clearly designed to work seamlessly with Apple products. Pairing was a breeze, and the connectivity is strong. Beats and Apple had a beautiful handshake with this product, and it shows.7) Lastly, the sound quality. This is unmatched with anything I've used prior. Has very clear audio, and a great range of tone. The bass is powerful, while balancing defined treble tones.A couple things to consider:-These don't have wireless charging (unlike my other gadgets). I need to plug them into USB-C to charge. Might not be a big deal for you, but this is a drawback on my radar.-Get a protective case! The existing charging case is well built, and sturdy - but if you're like me, and you put your phone in a protective case, do the same for your earbuds. The case I got was drop proof, and didn't add much to the size (it doesn't take up much space in my pocket). It was $10 for peace of mind. Get an airtag too while you're at it!Overall, would recommend!","Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2024",AFYYCTAQAUEWFDXYF7BHMXS66TJQ,True,159,Color: Black/GoldStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+
R3B9Y58P0GC1NL,B0C2W1KLSS,"5.0 out of 5 stars Top Tier, Best Buds I’ve Had So Far!!",CJ,5,"These earbuds are the best all around I’ve ever had. Truly. I’ve had 2 sets of these buds before these. I’ve had Jabra (4 pair), Bose (2 pair) Nothing One’s, and another pair I can’t think of the name of, but they sound great. The Beats Buds do it all around the best. Some are great for music but terrible for talking in the phone. Some were good for phone calls but the music wasn’t that great. Some create ear fatigue and discomfort after some time. I’ve carried 2 different pairs of other buds to use based on whether I’m listening to music or talking on the phone. These really do perform in all areas!","Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2024",AEBFHK3FSZQEFEUYQT23NPKGZQ4A,True,9,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+
R13FS9E750HR39,B0C2W1KLSS,4.0 out of 5 stars Great for Daily Use,IT Guy,4,"The media could not be loaded. Quick OverviewI bought these headphones to replace some other earbuds that were beginning to have issues and so far I have really enjoyed these headphones. Since these earbuds are made with Apple in mind, they have easy pairing just like Airpods. They also integrate with Siri to read your texts and notifications, etc. and give you a chance to respond which is a great feature I missed when using another brand. My only complaint at the moment is really just a minor inconvenience - because of the low profile of the earbuds they are harder to grab out of the case since only a few millimeters of the earbuds are sticking out to grab. If you have nails or bigger fingers you might find it annoying to grab out of the case.One of my favorite things about these earbuds is the fact that they have actual physical buttons, NOT have touch buttons. I wear hoodies and it’s so annoying when it brushes a touch button and pauses my music or turns noise cancelling on or off.Crisp and Clear Sound Quality:The sound quality is impressive across various genres of music. The earbuds deliver a well-balanced sound signature with clear vocals, detailed instrument separation, and a mostly satisfying bass response. The highs are crisp, without being harsh, and the mids are well-presented. The bass isn't as punchy as I would like, but with how small these earbuds are that is kind of to be expected. It does provides a good level of depth without overpowering the other frequencies, but if you like a lot of bass these might not be for you. Overall, the sound quality of will please most casual listeners alike and even some music enthusiasts. These earbuds lack customizable EQ settings. This may not be a big deal to some people, but I like to adjust the bass and the highs depending on the genre of music I am listening to.Comfortable and Secure Fit:These earbuds are designed with user comfort in mind. They come with multiple ear tip sizes to ensure a secure fit for different ear shapes. The lightweight and ergonomic design make them comfortable to wear. I've worn them for about 4 hours at a time and will sometimes forget they are there. Personally the Airpods didn't fit in my ear as well and these stay in better for me.Great Noise Cancellation:I prefer active noise cancellation because the fit of passive noise cancellation is usually less comfortable. These earbuds have a solid fit and use active noise cancellation which I prefer - and is pretty impressive. Typically I like to hear my environment when walking my dogs but the noise cancellation is so good I have to turn it off. I could keep noise cancellation on with my old headphones and it really just reduced how loud the noise was. This is also really helpful when I am on a call and my dogs are in the other room. I usually have to keep muting my mic because my dogs are barking, but when testing my girlfriend couldn't hear the dogs while we were on the phone.Incredibly Stable Bluetooth Connection:The connection between these earbuds and my phone is absolutely incredible. Bluetooth connection quality can vary quite a bit but these have one of the most stable and reliable connections that I have ever seen with wireless earbuds. There is virtually no latency. I left my phone in my bedroom and walked about 100 feet and went outside into the backyard and close the door. There wasn't even a stutter with the connection. Amazing.Battery Life:There is always a claim of an impressive battery life with high end earbuds. I haven't had a chance to test yet, but I plan to drain the battery completely on the earbuds and the case and track how long it takes to charge, how long the earbud batteries last, and how long the case battery lasts. I will update this review once I have had a chance to test!Overall the Beats Studio + offer a great audio experience and sound quality, comfortable fit, and amazing wireless connection. While there are a few minor inconveniences, none of them are dealbreakers and these earbuds are a great choice for anyone seeking a good pair of wireless earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2023",AGYDMBJ7K2SRHYL7DHHL37MLHDUQ,True,179,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+
R140XWBAUFV27O,B0C2W1KLSS,5.0 out of 5 stars Outstanding 👌🏽,Mr. Tovar Sr.,5,"Don't use the regular type c charging cord with USB on the other end, use type c cable with type c on both ends or your case won't charge to 100 percent not will ear buds. Just to help... Anyhoo lovely sound, deep bass, perfect highs, very light yet sturdy... Definitely engineered with us *Buyers* in mind 👍🏽 I love them. Also, please buy the clear case for this that includes the cleaning pen thing, isn't expensive but it fits better than a glove and protects this expensive earbud case and buds. Keeps lid closed and locked and looks awesome. Has a side loop for clip attachment... These are my new personal earbuds, won't use on jobs or nothing strenuous, just to enjoy music when at peace 👌🏽 ...

R5M5AUQEOJMSM,B0C2W1KLSS,3.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones with frustrating bug with iPhone,Laura G,3,"I like these headphones but there are some serious issues if you use these with an iPhone. Apple has owned Beats for a decade and when connected to Apple products, have a specific menu to control their functionality. I have a fully updated iPhone 11 Pro. Though it's not the newest phone, I should have to have the newest phone to use Apple-supported headphones.Pros:• I can switch between my phone, my iPad, and Macbook pretty easily. I don't have to forget my headphones on one thing in order to connect to another.• The sound quality is pretty good.• They stay in my ears well.• The physical button to pause or skip works well and has a nice feel.• Control of settings like listening mode and button function are in settings on the iOS or Mac OS without needing a third-party app or toggling manually through features on the headphones themselves.• When noise cancelling and transparent modes work, they work pretty well (see cons).Cons:• From day 1, these have had problems staying connected to my iPhone. If I pause or don't have audio playing for a short period of time (usually around 30 seconds though it's happened after about 15 seconds), the headphones disconnect. They will then attempt to reconnect but with no sound. You have to go into Bluetooth settings, disconnect the headphones, wait, and then reconnect. This is when the screen is active and being used, so it can't be blamed on the iOS going into a sleep mode or because the screen is dark. It happens on a daily basis if I pause to talk to someone or if I'm taking a moment to select my next song or YouTube video. Apple Support is no help as their solution is to forget the headphones and re-add them. This fixes the problem for less than a day. I don't have the issue if I'm connected to my laptop or iPad. Yes, my iOS is fully updated and yes, the headphones are fully charged. Again, this has been since I opened them and started using them.• After six months of use, the left earbud has an on and off thumping when I'm in noise cancelling or transparent mode. It's so bad, I've just resigned myself to not using either mode unless I have to.• No wireless charging option. This might be due to Apple proprietary tech, but it's still a con.• Approximately every two or three weeks, I can't change the noise cancelling settings because my phone thinks both headphones are out of the case (you can't use noise cancelling or transparent mode with one earbud). I would have to turn my phone off and restart it to get the modes to work again.Overall, the headache these headphones cause is not worth the convenience of their auto compatibility with Apple products or their sound quality. Apple needs to look into the bugs for iPhone and not brush them off. Won't be buying again and I'm looking for a new alternative to Apple Airpods.","Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2024",AGX7ZX53ATOLBXKS3QMWZIUUG4AQ,True,11,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

RAORBYYPJJ3F6,B0C2W1KLSS,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great for everyday use, but not for everyone.",Justin,3,"The build quality of the beats are phenomenal. The sound quality on the other hand was slacking. The vocal clarity was great for podcasts and watching movies but when I was listening to music with really any type of bass, the sound seemed to always crackle or breakup. The noise canceling on these earbuds are okay but by no means great. Were these really shine is the call quality. The voice clarity on both ends of a call was fantastic. The easy pair for IOS was very helpful and simple but I wish there was a EQ added. The comfort for me was great for the first hour but after that it really started to hurt my ears even after swapping ear tips. I would say these are great for everyday use and most people would really enjoy them but for me that really didn’t work out. I would recommend these to people if they don’t work in loud environments and listen to softer music or something of that nature. I do say these aren’t worth the price tag that is put on them but if you catch them on sale you won’t be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2024",AEMAUUWREGQR3FBZXIPWQEZHGDNQ,True,10,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+
RNM65C0JO1ZNO,B0C2W1KLSS,4.0 out of 5 stars My Very Honest Love/Hate Review,Ashley,4,"HateThey are kind of difficult to put/keep in your ears. I have tried different size cushions and it did help some but there are times when I don’t have my hands free and they start to slip out. Very frustrating. I have 1 more complaint and it may just be me but people have a hard time hearing me when I take a call with them on. 90% of the time I have to take them out to finish my conversation.LoveOn a positive note the battery life is really good. They send out 2-3 warning alerts to let you know the batteries are nearing the end of their life. it’s great because it gives you plenty of time before your cut off. If your like me and only wear 1 at a time, the alerts gives you lots of time to switch out to the other bud before your cut off.I also love the noise canceling feature but if you don’t love it there is actually a setting that lets you turn it off. As always Beats are #1 when it comes to sound!","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2024",AF3XZJNDRPBEJGF47VD3PREGKJ7Q,True,0,Color: IvoryStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+
RR59V1YTAKMN3,B0C2W1KLSS,3.0 out of 5 stars Be aware if you are an AirPods user...,P. Liu,3,"For me, the battery life at around 75% volume is around 7h50m with ANC and Transparency set to Off. The sound quality, and I've owned several HiFi headsets including HiFiMan and Sennheiser's, is nothing ground breaking or it's just typical Beats. So it's okay if you know the Beats sound. For my ears, the default plugs works fine and doesn't appear to fall out.So, several things to note:1) it Does Not automatically switch sources on Apple platforms like AirPods does(you have to manually switch)! It does, however, pair once and connects to all of your devices under the same Apple ID. So it sits somewhere in between the traditional BT headset and an AirPods.2) The case is wider than AirPods Pro case by more than ~1/2"" and taller by ~1/4""... So, kinda big but pocketable.3) For reasons unclear to me, mine unit charges to 98-99%... Not sure what's causing that4) No iOS 'Fit Test' for these buds... So choosing the right plug is your call!5) One reason I'm debugging and still might return the item: On a phone call or FaceTime call, at some point in the call, the other person can not hear my voice until I switch back to either Speaker or iPhone. The little Googling I did suggest that I'm not alone in this, and switching to Speaker then Back to the Buds might recover the microphone. But it's unacceptable for my sound to drop out on a call and not knowing it's happening until the other parties mentioned it. Until I can resolve this, I won't be doing any phone calls or using the microphones on this thing... Unresolved, I will return it!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AF5USDTPPMDQCVOELHMZTQMMA42Q,True,0,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

I appreciate the attempt to make a product more buyer accessible than their powerbeats pro/fit (which at this point are simply overpriced). That said, these buds+ are lackluster at just about everything except listening to audio in quiet-moderately loud environments.Pros: They fit well enough, stay in ear, and are comfortable enough that i often walk into meetings forgetting that I have them in (and then end up yelling a bit do to the anc dulling).Cons: These are absolutely terrible for phone and video calls (facetime, whatsapp, Teams, Zoom, etc). Multiple chats have resulted in me giving up and using my gym headphones or the built in speaker. If these weren't a gift, i'd be upset as travel/in office is my main use case. IYou're better off buying airpods if you want something all around. OR pay more for the powerbeats or Sony buds (could be others that are solid but those are the two i can directly speak to). If you just want decent quality audio for at home or travel, then I suggest you get these on a sale and don't pay more than ~$90 for them.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AEDYCUQ5SNLQNTZFGDXQMFM2UMEQ,True,0,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

I asked around at work and it was a tie between these and the second gen airpods pro for popularity. Having an android phone, I knew that if I went with the airpods again, all the headache that would come with using them with an android phone, so I bought the beats studio buds +. Despite having one of the longest names in beats history, these buds have just as long of a battery, claiming nine hours on a charge, which when using them during 12 hour work shifts, I can attest to being true and then some. As someone who has never liked noise cancelling headphones, I actually really enjoy these, especially when on a bus or a plane, they make a huge difference. The sound quality is sharp and clean, and the bass is not overpowering, but still quite noticeable, using the same tricks as the airpods pro. This shouldn't be a surprise because these use the same chip as the airpods family of headphones, so they work great on iPhone, but just as well on android.Pairing is simple and controlled using an app (on Android), which allows all control that would normally be found in iPhone settings","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2024",AHQOAZEU53L72SUQOALTM7EC3YKQ,True,2,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

The sound quality is good for the price. Scale of 1 to 10. Bass is 7 and Treble is 8. Sound is crisp with no interference or background hiss. Bluetooth is strong, comparable to AirPods if not slightly better. Only drawback is the earbud housing material is slick plastic making it an effort to remove from the case especially in cold weather when the fingers are dry. A grippier material would work better to remove them from the case. I recommend these earbuds if you want to step up prior to investing AirPods.

Being able to change the volume from the buds themselves isn't a feature on the studio plus. Also, trying to pause audio is uncomfortable since you're pressing the buds further into your ear.","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2024",AF5ZNZYLGP2YYF5LOXK5FAYTJONQ,True,1,Color: IvoryStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

It usually works, but sometimes something strange happens and the people I am talking to complain about the voice quality. This has nothing to do with the noise level because it happens in pretty quiet places as well.For listening to music and audio books it is excellent. My favorite thing is that each earbud can be used independently while the other one is charging. This means that I can listen to podcasts and audio books non-stop. Battery life is very good as well. ANC is excellent as well.The only complaint I have is with the microphone being flaky. Everything else is amazing.

I have found many Noise Cancelling headphones block the noise out for me, but not for the callers on the other end.These work amazing when I am on my cell phone. I tested it out where I was driving with my windows down, then I turned my radio up. I record myself leaving a message so that I can hear what the other person hears. These did great blocking a lot of the sound out for the caller on the other end when on my cell phone.When on Zoom or Google Meet calls on the computer, these did a lot better than any others I had. It didn't do as well as when I was on my cell phone, but still blocked out some of the noise around me for the other callers.The downside to these is the fit. I have small ears and have trouble finding earbuds that will stay in my ear. Unfortunately, I have to adjust these often and I don't find them as comfortable, but, again, I have small ears. So for the average person, these would likely work well.If you are using them to listen to music, the sound quality is okay.

With my previous pair of earbuds it was impossible to talk on the phone with a loud background, it was impossible for the person on the other end of the line to hear. However with the Beats earbuds I can talk on the phone without worrying about how loud the background noise is.CONS the noise cancellation mode is not great, anytime it’s activated it has a humming sound and that is annoying. It also is adaptive to how loud the background noise is but that only works half the time. A previous pair of earbuds that cost $50 had much better noise cancellation with no humming noises.","Reviewed in the United States December 14, 2023",AETQNVVZ7DU2QWDFWQLERFQ74AIA,True,9,Color: Black/GoldStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

RWUFM677B047O,B0C2W1KLSS,5.0 out of 5 stars One of the best out there but...,Honest Reviewer Zach,5,"This is hands down one of the best earbuds in the world period. Some cons that I've noticed after using them are.Cons:-The left earbud has low static sound when nothing is playing.-The earbuds pick up a ton of background noise with their microphones. But it's normal.-Note that it's impossible to speak to someone on the phone while, for example you're at a pretty loud gym.-Putting one earbud into the case, pauses whatever you're playing from your phone.-I personally never use transparency mode. However, when putting one earbud into the case, it always switches to transparency mode, and you have to manually change it on the app. The app doesn't allow to set default modes.Pros:-They are build very strong, and earbuds wouldn't come apart and break even if you step on them.-Earbuds are able to connect/link to two devices at the same time and switch between them seamlessly. Few earbuds have this capability if any.-Additionally, earbuds are able to link to your Google account and connect to devices much easier.Overall, very good noise cancellation, sound quality, decent bass, battery life, charging speed, design, feel, and look.Two month update: Sometimes the system notifications get messed up - it notifies you about the percentage of the case and both earbuds every 5 seconds. Sometimes one of the earbuds goes out, without a low battery warning. Putting them into a case for a few seconds fixes this. Also sometimes the noise cancelling gets messed up - it does the exact opposite - adds noise. Again putting both of the earbuds for a couple of seconds into the case fixes this.Six month update:I had to send this product for repair (directly to apple) tree times before all issues were fixed. The first two times, it was free, but the third time I had to pay $84 for them to get fixed.","Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2023",AELKL63BZ7XFD27KO3R6BEVSDWRA,True,65,Color: TransparentStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

I bought these as a much needed replacement for my first gen AirPods that I purchased at launch. Thus far, I have used the earphones around the house while doing chores, relaxing on the couch, and at work. The sound quality is pretty good. While the earphones themselves have no equalizer settings, I mostly use Spotify and have been able to tune the buds to my desired taste through Spotify.The active noise canceling is easy to turn on/off and I was really surprised how well they work. My washing/dryer unit can be fairly noisy in my open floor plan apartment. I could not hear it running at all when I put the noise canceling on.I love the aesthetic of the buds and they fit perfectly in my ears out of the box. I do miss the feature of my AirPods where the buds would start/stop playing if it was inserted/removed from my ears. I can see myself accidentally putting the buds down and forgetting they are still going. I deducted a star because while the case and buds are stylish and sleek, I find they are a bit too smooth. the buds are a little difficult to firmly grasp and I’m afraid they’ll slip out of my fingers while handling them.

(Like the way you ""hunt"" for the right way to insert a USB cable. 🙂) This feature improved usability for me and I'm mentioning here in case the manufacturer has anyone reading these reviews for future improvements.I like how you can use the app to customize behavior /settings of the earbuds, and really like how if you leave one inserted, it can (with the right settings) use amplification to make it so you're hearing normally, as though nothing is blocking your ear canal.I was used to other earbuds that were capacitive touch and wanted to point out that these are tactile touch, meaning you need to push the surface of the earbud to click the button. You'll feel a little click when it works each time but it's barely perceptible and not annoying.The only problem I had and ultimately had to return them is that I routinely had feedback on calls that the mics were inconsistently picking up my voice.","Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2024",AFEHMC3NEQ5CJN4XTMXZZBK7NPCQ,True,5,Color: Cosmic SilverStyle: Studio Buds +Set: Without AppleCare+

I also thought the sound was a lot more sharp, like s, sh, and f sounds were super highlighted and tinny for my liking.

Speaking of the case the new clear option for both it and the buds is great and in my opinion the way to go. Battery life is outstanding for the size of the buds and the case. Ear tips are mid, but get the job done. I would always get a good pair of foam tips for ear buds anyways though. I would and have recommended these to friends looking for a new pair of buds.

Everyone knows Apple has their own technology work better with their phones or whatever it’s no hidden thing, but let me tell you, these sound so crystal clear when listening to music, social media, and on calls. The quality alone is so nice! And the features, immerse (you can listen around you) adaptive (it’ll block out white noise and annoying sounds) and noise cancellation (you can’t hear just about anything around you) it’s so wild. These things aren’t even that tight in my ears but it’s like you put noise cancellation on and it shuts off the outside world. I have this as a mechanic and it’s just white noise everywhere with these in it’s so comfortable walking around the shop having like ear plugs in essentially. Also, the battery life is great. I charged it fully when I got them and it’s lasted me like a week on the case? I have my headphones in around 6 hours at work listening to social media. I probably take them out to charge them walking around the shop or going on break and I’ve never seen the buds really go below 80% after hours of listing tbh which is kinda wild.

The sound, whether audio book, music, or phone calls, is completely clear and intense. When listening to music you can hear every instrument clearly. When listening to audio books you feel as you are right next to the author or narrator reading the book. Phone calls are of excellent quality both hearing and speaking, even speaking very softly the person that you are speaking to can hear your clearly. The best, for me, is that I can listen a very low volume and receive an immersive experience.

You can locate each individual AirPod + the case too with the “Find My” app. It will show a live visual of how many feet away you are from your AirPods/case. And let you play a beeping sound from the AirPods themselves or the cases’s speakers.These AirPods Pro’s also have Personalizable Spatial Audio with Head Tracking. And best in-class noise cancellation + transparency modes.The Battery life is super duper solid. And IF your AirPod’s battery does get low a 5 minute charge gets you back to over 50%Last but not least if you have multiple devices on the Apple ecosystem they will SEAMLESSLY switch between your devices.Please do yourself a favor and also purchase AppleCare+ ($29) it will cover majority of the issues your AirPods MIGHT have for the next 24months.Don’t walk, RUN. 11/10.

R35DCJIFRA6ASI,B0D1XD1ZV3,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Quality & Upgrade from Pro 1st Gen,Dilan Luke Cairns,5,"So I was skeptical about upgrading to the next generation of air pod pro but I have to admit that it is a fantastic choice. To specify I have the iPhone 15 pro max. I’ve had the first gen AirPods forever and gotta say that this upgrade makes a huge impact if you’re someone who is about the quality of music. While I mentioned music, they have universal features! I would like to mention some of the new features like conversation awareness and adaptive transparency mode. Conversation awareness will detect anytime you speak and it will lower the volume of your media accordingly. It’s a nice feature, but it can be annoying sometimes as it will significantly lower volume. (Don’t talk to yourself) or just turn it on/off as needed. The adaptive transparency only activates noise cancellation on things that are louder than the recommended volume.With that out of the way, let’s talk about the Bluetooth distance. I walked into the woods while leaving my phone at my seat. I cannot give an exact distance, however, I can vouch that I had perfect/clear audio for longer than expected. Almost as if the songs that were playing were programmed directly into the AirPods! It wasn’t until I was in a completely unreasonable distance that the audio would cut in/out. (Without any impact on the quality of audio) This is probably the biggest upgrade for any pod-type/earbuds headphones. 10/10 recommend even if you already have the first generation of AirPod Pros!","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AFNG6HPINHPKNYO5CUKIZTWQL3PA,True,1,
R1MVIG488P2B5S,B0D1XD1ZV3,5.0 out of 5 stars Don't buy these on Ebay!!,Craig,5,"You know the old saying, ""You get what you pay for!"" I know these AirPods are not cheap and about 5 months ago I bought a pair on Ebay because they were $100. They were advertised as the same Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation) and looked identical but operated much different.First, the AirPods would not do a simple handoff from one Apple device to another. Second, there was no way to make a phone call because it had no microphone. I read that perhaps the software needed to be updated to fix the handoff issue and after no luck getting that done I took them to an Apple store. The store assistant ran a serial number check and said my AirPods were supposed to be shipped overseas so I would never be able to do a software update. I actually got a full refund from the Ebay seller when I told them what I discovered; they said not to bother sending the AirPods back.Now after 5 months my Ebay AirPods completely stopped charging so I threw them away and I immediately purchased these AirPods from Amazon. The AirPods I purchased from Amazon sound better, do the handoff correctly and have an ""adaptive noise control"" that was not an option with the Ebay version I purchased. Amazon sells the correct Apple product and these are well worth the investment.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AFZ2FCSAERV6JJM4NZQJNHBVC43A,True,13,

I am 67 so was anxious about yet another electronic product lol. I checked on this product last year as a Black Friday purchase but didn't make it in time. I felt this price was close enough to that price to not wait till this holiday. These are my first air pods to have but were easy to set up. (I used and recommend a 9 or so minute You Tube video demonstration which was helpful in setup ).I purchased these to use on the treadmill when too cold or hot out. They cancel the noise well, are comfortable to wear, and sound quality is good. The battery longevity is still in question as I just purchased and have used only once. so can edit review later when have had time to evaluate. I think having these will encourage me to exercise as I won't have to fight with the ear buds with long cord that connect to my phone that I was previously using.","Reviewed in the United States June 26, 2024",AHC5IFWCXTVBSWT6O3KGIDE55GLQ,True,1,

I needed to replace an older pair that had developed persistent charging and connection issues. However, I purchased AppleCare+ protection along with my Airpods here and that was a mistake. I received a ""digital delivery confirmation"" that same day, but when I downloaded to my Software Library, it was just a generic PDF about what was/wasn't covered but contained no agreement number or anything specific to my order. Apple wasn't able to associate my purchased protection plan with my Airpods, even with proof of purchase for both the Airpods and AppleCare+. So right before my window of eligibility ended, I had to purchase a new AppleCare+ plan through Apple directly and ask Amazon for a refund. I appreciate Amazon handling the $25 refund, but it took about an hour on the phone with Apple while chatting with Amazon to get this figured out.","Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2024",AFX5QQY5YBMVEQCGBCJWVA2JJE6Q,True,1,

My best part of this one is the design choice Apple went with this, this actually stays in your ear unlike the other Apple Airpods. Hell it’s even better than the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro and this is coming from a guy who switch from Samsung to iPhone. If you gonna get some AirPods save up for this one & get it on sale, Amazon sells it cheaper than any other stores. I have no issues with this AirPods, but if you want me to be petty. My only issue is Apple not using this design choice on the old ones would love to see this AirPods cheaper with this design choice where it stays in your ear and blocks out black ground noise.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AFASUIXITMOPKGGI5OYV5A6PWOWQ,True,0,

To my surprise, I found out they're already set up with all my other devices that use the same Apple id. My Mac Mini M2, 4 different Apple tv's, My older iPad 10.2 9th generation. I bought them because of a YouTube video I saw ""How to use your Airpods Pro 2 as hearing aids"". Followed the directions and they work perfectly for me. I'll soon be buying a second set due to the fact that these are only rated for up to 6 hours when used as hearing aids. BTW - There is NO mention of these anywhere in Apple's description about using them for hearing aids BUT the settings are in the iPhone. Therefore they are not supported to be used in that manor. I should also mention that you only need the iPhone to set them up for the first time since they retain the settings. After that the iPhone is not required for use as hearing aids.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AE47VLFCODDA7WQP6UFNESIUVRQA,True,2,

My last earbuds (Beats Fit Pros), I used so much the past 2 1/2 years that it literally started falling apart. I’ve been digging chunks of white plastic out of my ears the past few weeks.Since the airpods pro may be more common among the population, I’m hoping these are more durable. The issue I already have though is that these are falling out of my ears more than I’d like. I must use third-party, rubber ear grips to ensure they don’t fall out while I’m on the bus or subway.I don’t want to be negative but this is Apple’s last chance for me. I’ve gone through all their high-end earbuds and they either don’t hold a charge, don’t always connect to my iPhone, or physically fall apart after 2 years of regular use. I’m impressed with the laundry list of supported software features for iPhone users, but less so with the shiny and slippery pieces of plastic I’m holding in my ears.

They ended up in my washing machine because I'm dumb, but the buds still worked perfectly fine when I took them out! The case needed a few hours before it would hold a charge again, but it's back to normal operation. Thank you Sony, this ADHDer was saved from having to spend more on a new pair! 🙌🏾Also, I recall seeing some other reviews say these buds can't be used separately, but I've used just the right one with the left still in the case with no issues. Your mileage may vary, I guess-------I don't leave reviews unless I'm truly blown away by a product and I know these LinkBuds are the best I've had, and I've only been using them for a few minutes! In the past three years, I have gone through Jabra Elite 75t -> Soundcore A40 -> Soundcore Sport X10. Here is where they fell short for me:- The Elite 75t was pretty good imo, the battery just aged out of use and it started having a lot of connectivity issues- The A40 sound was muffled and terrible, the noise canceling was a joke, and it would not stay in my ears unless I pushed the buds in super deep, which made them unpleasant to wear for an extended period- The Sport X10 fixed the issue of having my buds fall out and the sound was really good, but they pushed on my crus of helix if they weren't constantly adjusted, and now I have a discolored mark on that part of my ear that's sensitive to the touch. Yippee... The battery was also super weak, I felt like I had to charge the buds almost every night to get just three hours out of them.The LinkBuds have everything I was looking for, and then some!+ They look large, but they are a perfect fit for my small ears! I didn't even have to swap out the cups. I can shake my head and it doesn't feel like they'll just fly out. Very snug and comfortably seated (and no pressure on my crus of helix, anymore!)+ The control sensors are perfectly calibrated and responsive. I usually prefer buttons because sensors can be finicky (Looking at you, Soundcore...), but the amount of pressure and presses needed for the earbuds to respond feels very natural and consistent.+ The EQ customization is versatile and very easy to set up. The default profile sounded kind of underwhelming, but after calibrating it to my preferred settings, it's hard to want to stop playing my tunes!+ The noise canceling is phenomenal, I truly can't hear anything but my own thoughts when it's activated. Switching to ambient noise is very smooth too.+ Speak-to-chat is a feature I've long missed having on my audio devices, so it was a pleasant surprise to see that option on the app.Overall, I have zero complaints thus far and I hope to use the LinkBuds for a long time :)","Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2024",AH7WNIY6WWU4TYDQ7Q5HLSY6SH4Q,True,29,Color: Black
R11XKM5NH30ZUQ,B09YL76VSR,5.0 out of 5 stars The best true wireless earphones for everyone,James,5,"The Sony Linkbuds S are a shrunk-down, improved version of the already excellent WF-1000XM4. I wasn't expecting this. Given the ""Linkbuds"" moniker I was expecting them to prioritize ambient sound features over all else, just like the original Linkbuds, but that simply isn't the case here.Build: the Linkbuds S are impossibly small compared to the WF-1000XM4, Sony's previous noise canceling earphones. They actually resemble the Samsung Galaxy buds 2 in overall size and shape. They also sport a nice large touch sensitive area that no one should have trouble missing. The only gripe I do have is that the outer surface is textured and this can cause some discomfort if it rubs against the crus helix.Case: the case is definitely one of the more pocketable out there. It's about the same size as the Airpods Pro case, but slightly shorter and narrower, albeit a bit thicker. However, it also has a textured surface which can make it a little difficult to slide in and out of pockets.Fit: the Linkbuds S fit very similar to the Galaxy Buds 2 and deeper than the WF-1000XM4. They are a little fiddly to fit. In my case I have to rotate them back and forth to get them to seat correctly. Although Sony instructs users to rotate the buds backwards to get a good fit I actually found this uncomfortable because the buds would rub against my Crus Helix and cause discomfort. Rotating them forward slightly fixed the issue. Once the buds were in place I found the fit to be secure and that, combined with their light weight, meant that it was easy to forget they were there. My one complaint about the fit is that the buds are so small that it's very difficult to insert them without either accidentally hitting the touch area or rubbing a finger against the noise canceling microphone, resulting in some static noise.Noise canceling: the noise canceling on the Linkbuds S is fantastic. Although the Linkbuds S are advertised as being open I actually found them to be more isolating than the WF-1000XM4s without noise canceling on. With noise canceling on I actually found the Linkbuds S to be slightly superior to the WF-1000XM4 in terms of blocking out background noise and they certainly blow the Galaxy Buds Pro/2 out of the water. I haven't had chance to test the Linkbuds S with very low frequency sounds (e.g. public transport, planes) but for blocking out office and household noise they're the best true wireless earphones I've tried.Sound: I saved the best to last. I was very pleasantly surprised with the sound quality of the Linkbuds S. The WF-1000XM4s were a big disappointment in this regard, with an overly dark presentation for my taste that led to recessed mids and lackluster treble. The Linkbuds S by comparison adopt a Harman-like tuning that presents mids and treble brilliantly with a satisfying bass boost that doesn't dominate the overall sound. The Linkbuds S definitely beat the WF-1000XM4s for overall sound and they're up there with the Galaxy Buds Pro/2, which are the reigning champs. Comparing the Galaxy Buds side by side with the Linkbuds S I honestly can't pick a favorite amongst the three, which I think is a very good thing.Other: in my limited tests the transparency features are great, as with the WF-1000XM4s. The only other thing that I think is worth noting is that the Linkbuds S struggle to maintain LDAC connectivity more than the WF-1000XM4s. This isn't surprising, given the small size, but is worth considering for anyone who wants to use LDAC in challenging environments or on the go.Wrap up: previously if I wanted to recommend a pair of true wireless earphones for someone I would have to include a 'but'. The Airpods Pro have great noise canceling but the sound isn't top tier and they don't play well with Android devices. The Galaxy Buds sound fantastic but the noise canceling isn't great and they don't play well with iOS. The WF-1000XM4s have top tier noise canceling and work well with both iOS and Android devices, but their sound isn't the best. The Linkbuds S on the other hand have top tier noise canceling, work excellent with both iOS and Android, and have excellent sound. These are now my default recommendation to anyone looking for new True Wireless earphones.Alternative picks: If it wasn't for the better Bluetooth connectivity of the WF-1000XM4s and the improved battery life the Linkbuds S would have made the XM4s redundant. Whether the increased price is worth it for those things will be up to the individual. I think there's still a case to be made for getting the cheaper Galaxy buds over the Linkbuds S if noise canceling isn't a priority. However, I think the only reason to pay more for the Airpods Pro would be if you really like the design and/or the enhanced integration with iOS is really important.","Reviewed in the United States May 22, 2022",AH6VAXGHQYGPVVIMRNEKENKN7ISQ,True,247,Color: Black

This gives an idea of my overall opinions, but for more details continue to read on below.)(Note- I will mostly be comparing these to other earbuds that I have used and/or reviewed recently: AirPods Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, Echo Buds2, and Klipsch T5 II )THE GOOD:--Comfort/Fit: So far, these are very comfortable to wear. They are slightly smaller than some of the other earbuds I've tested, and are up there with Airpods Pro in terms of comfort. They also feel very secure in the ear, unlike some other brands. No complaints here with comfort/design.--Mic Quality: The mic quality of these is excellent. I tested out with calling friends, and these were either 1st or 2nd best sounding earbuds according to the people I called. My friend says that these mics are the best out the earbuds we tested in this range.--Multiple Ecosystem Support: These work well with all ecosystems, whether you are using Apple or Android; and with assistants including Alexa and Google.--Good ANC : The noise canceling on these is also fantastic. This technology has come a long way, and sometimes it can be hard to compare ANC, since each company produces earbuds that prioritize blocking out slightly different frequencies. To me these seem like they are close to the best , but maybe the XM4s and Airpods Pro are SLIGHTLY better, especially the XM4s at low frequency ranges. The Adaptive Sound Control is a neat feature that can change ambient sound settings based on your location, though I'm not sure how useful this will be in practice.THE BAD:--Overall Sound Comparison: With the default EQ settings, the overall sound quality actually seems slightly worse than the WF1000XM4s to me. I also prefer the sound of the Klipsch T5 IIs with most music, and even the Galaxy Pros with some songs; as these LinkBuds S can sometimes sound slightly muffled or dampened in comparison. Still good quality sound overall, just not as good as some of the other options in this range, and not my favorite with any type of music I tested.--No Wireless Charging: This seems like a big disappointment for this price range. I would expect that ALL earbuds that are over $200 should have wireless charging at this point.MORE DETAILS:Here are my thoughts on each category, again mostly comparing to: Airpods Pro, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4, Echo Buds2, and Klipsch T5 II. (I also enlisted the help of a friend of mine that is an Audio Engineer, to give his opinions and to use some of his equipment.)Sound - These sounded great to me when I first put them in and listened to a variety of music. I was not disappointed in overall sound quality at all, and if you aren't comparing these to anything else, you will also probably think that they sound great. It was only after rigorously measuring their output with my friend's mics, and also repeatedly comparing them to all of the other earbuds, that I was able to notice the slightly muffled sound compared to the other earbuds. The Airpods Pro, Klipsch T5 II, XM4, and Galaxy Pro all seem slightly more “clear”, with a broader range. The midrange on the Airpods Pro might be the biggest difference here, and when I switched back and forth between them I felt like I was missing some of those midrange frequencies with the LinkBuds S. Overall sound range/EQ preferences are of course very subjective and personal, but my friend and I both agree that these are definitively not our favorite in this category.Design/Fit – I like the way that these fit in my ear, and they are right up there at the top with Airpods and Klipsch in terms of being lightweight and comfortable. For me, the Galaxy Pros were a little to clunky and felt like they might fall out sometimes, but the LinkBuds S fit great while also feeling secure. The texture of the buds themselves is almost a little scratchy, which took me a little while to get used to, but I think I prefer this texture for touch sensitivity. For me though, I have always preferred the press-able buttons on the Klipsch T5 IIs over all of these touch sensors, partly because I often wear a headband over the earbuds and a sweaty headband can mess with the touch sensors sometimes.Calls – This is probably the best overall feature of these earbuds. The microphone quality seemed to be the best out of all the earbuds when testing out on my friend's equipment, and in real-world testing I experienced similar results. These were either the best sounding, or a close second best when compared to other earbuds when making calls. These sounded the best in almost every environment, maybe tied for best with Klipsch in noisy/windy environments.Water Resistance - These have the same IPX4 rating as most of the other earbuds, but note that the Galaxy Buds Pro have a superior IPX7 rating, if that matters to you. So far these have been working great for exercise, but again personally I prefer more headband-friendly designs sometimes.Charging/etc: These charge at about the same speed as the other earbuds, and have a similar battery life. The BIG difference is that these don't support wireless charging, which seems odd at this price range. These come with a short 9 inch usb-A to usb-C cable in the box, no plug/brick. This is my least favorite in terms of charging options compared to the other earbuds in this price range.OVERALL: These are solid earbuds that feel great, produce good sound, have good ANC, and have excellent microphones for great call quality. They do just about everything well, but at this current price I can't say that they are my favorite, or even the best value. Overall my favorites are probably still the Klipsch T5 IIs, which are currently less expensive than these LinkBuds S earbuds at the time I'm writing this. My second favorite would either be the Galaxy Pros or the Airpod Pros, both of which are slightly less expensive and produce slightly better sound in my opinion. The only thing these LinkBuds S are the best at seems to be the mic/call quality, but even then the difference there isn't big enough for me to recommend choosing them overall. Personally I'm sticking with my Klipsch T5 IIs for regular use, but if you are a diehard Apple user, I would have recommend the Airpods Pro over these LinkBuds S at the current prices. If these drop in price in the future and are competitively priced with some of the other options, then they might be a good choice; especially if switching back and forth between ecosystems is important to you and you don't mind the lack of wireless charging.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2022",AGJNDB3P4G3BWHS23YMSCRBRFIFA,True,356,Color: Black
R12X9VLBJKRPJP,B09YL76VSR,5.0 out of 5 stars Impressed,P.A.,5,"I had the WF-1000XM4 and they sounded great, had superb ANC, transparency, and features But what got me was the size. They are big, stick out from the ears, and impossible to lay in bed and listen to tunes or podcasts, because on the pillow side, it would push into the ear. And, due to the size, they would have the tendency to come loose and I would have to always readjust them. I've tried aftermarket ear tips, but generally the same result. Now homes the LinkBuds S. In many ways, they are like the mini XM4. They have none of the negatives that I had with the XM4's, although, you are missing a little bit. The ANC is better on the XM4's, as is the battery life. But like the big brother, they have superb sound. The ANC is really good (just not XM4 level) and the transparency is right up there, almost on par with them too. Being that it has a 6hr battery life (With the AAC codec - I use an iPhone, so no LDAC for me) and with ANC and transparency off, I can still get through a session of listening with no issues, as I never keep them in for more than a few hours at a time. They are by far more comfortable than the XM4's due to their size, which is considerably smaller. They almost sit flush in my ears. And they are lighter too. Performed many head shake tests, and these do not fail. Of course, your mileage may vary since not all ears are shaped the same. The photo shows them in the Spigen Rugged Armor case. Which I also recommend. I'm very impressed by these and I'm glad I bought them.","Reviewed in the United States May 1, 2023",AFX6CY6EGKPY5FKE37C2LLXTGAZA,True,12,Color: Black
RINCOH95UGPPV,B09YL76VSR,1.0 out of 5 stars Not for me,Javier Ruiz,1,"Starting with the good: these are good looking Ear buds, feel well built. The sound quality is also good, as is the ANC, which works very well. I also really like the touch controls. They work very well, and they can be modified from the Sony Headphones app.Now for the bad:They do not fit my ears very well. I recognize that this is very subjective, but for me, even with the largest tips in place, it feels like the buds are not very secure in my ears, meaning any strong movement of my head would be enough to dislodge them. This feeling is amplified by the fact that depending on how I put them in my ears, they feel more Or less secure. Most earbuds I have owned are designed to be secure when inserted. These.. not so much.The other big thing I don’t like is the app. It does work, for setting the modes (normal, transparency and ANC), as well as EQ settings and you can also set it up to work with Alexa (but not Siri for some reason). But what bothers me is that in order to use it, you have an agree to a lot of tracking and data collection. This is ostensibly to make some features work (like the ability to set profiles for different locations, like work; home, etc.) however, it make me think of his is a thinly veiled way to collect data of your movements. That is not something I care to do, so I declined it. But it is a shame that to unlock all the features of a device, you must consent to be tracked.UPDATE JULY 2023:I have downgraded my review from 3 to 1 stars, because in the short (and I mean really short) time that I have owned them, I find that they keep disconnecting from my phone at oddtimes. Today, for example, I was on a FaceTime call and my buds decided to disconnect halfway through it. Mind you, they were fully charged. This is unacceptable. The earbuds I had before stayed connected the entire time I was using them, not to mention their ANC and battery life was about on par with the Sony’s, but they were half the price of these!Another reason to dislike these: you will NOT get any notifications from Siri on these . The only assistant that will work with them is Alexa. At first it did not seem like such an issue because I usually activate Siri from my phone. But not being able to get actual, verbal notifications from Siri through these earbuds is amazing, considering the price. Again, my old buds did this too. I only replaced them because I lost them And stupidly, I thought these would be an upgrade. Goes to show that price is not always an indicator of quality. It used to be that when you bought something from Sony you knew you were getting a quality . But more and more these days, what you are paying for is the brand name recognition. That’s it.As for me, I think I will keep these for limited uses for the next year or two, and then I will dispose of them like the e-waste that they are. Seriously. Over $150 with taxes for a device to have such glaring omissions and poor quality, when other companies produce much better devices for a lot less? That’s unconscionable.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2023",AHIJXOAYGDXQN7RW2VM7CGWNBIIA,True,30,Color: White
R35YY0BHG4UC3K,B09YL76VSR,5.0 out of 5 stars These are incredible.,Raymond,5,"I bought a pair as soon as these were on sale. Amazing. These are incredible. I believe way better than the sony xm4 which I have. These will be my main. I really like the small form factor. They are more snugged in my ears and less obvious so I can wear them while I'm at work. The only downside is the battery doesn't last as long as the xm4. Xm4s I get about 7-8 hours playing medium loud bass music but with these, I get about 5-6. Seems to take longer to charge as well. Thankfully, I can use the xm4 and the s link interchangeably so the battery is not a problem at all. 10/10.Another helpful thing I want to mention, I believe ""S"" stands for silent since a lot of people were complaining about the voice commands in the Sony Xm4. These ones, do not have any voice command when you switch from ambient to ANC. It's completely silent.","Reviewed in the United States November 1, 2023",AHHMMFP22NU35JFB6FALOBEEAKXQ,True,18,Color: Black
R32Q1G43LPWAC5,B09YL76VSR,3.0 out of 5 stars Uninpressive...even on sale,Ian,3,"Let me start this by remarking that while I’ve been using Bluetooth earbuds since they came out, I only really have one set that is comparable to the linkbuds S, which is the Sennheiser CX plus buds I got a year ago. It’s a pretty even comparison from price and features (I got them both on sale).If you just care about good sound for music, call clarity, and comfort, then you might just love the Linkbuds S. If you care about features like transparent hearing mode, battery life, noise canceling, or app usability…I’d recommend that you keep looking.Sound: Even after taking pictures of my ears (awkward), testing tips for optimal ear pressure, and all the other things Sony wanted me to do, my CX plus buds out of the box sound better. 360 sound and app optimization was snake oil if you ask me. It is not a huge difference with most music, but I can really tell when listening to podcasts or audiobooks. The CX plus sound like the person is reading to you in a silent room, while the linkbuds sound no different than my 4 year old $30 generic buds. I even tried changing to the comply foam tips I use in all my buds, and while it usually improves things, I couldn’t tell the difference when using the linkbuds.Call Clarity/Singal: A tie here. Both have very clear call clarity on both ends. I had no problems with singals dropping in Bluetooth heavy areas, both had similar range, and I carry my phone in my front pocket and never had drops with either.Comfort/size: The Linkbuds S win this category by a massive margin. They are comfortable and conforming. So much so that this is the only aspect that gave me pause when returning them. This is where the foam tips usually come into play, but the linkbuds were just always comfortable regardless of the tips. MY CX plus buds get very uncomfortable after a couple hours which made me really appreciate the linkbuds in this regard.ANC/Transparency mode: A big nope on both. For Transparency mode, my CX plus buds might have me spoiled, but I love that mode because it sounds natural, but boosted. The linkbuds makes everything sound tinny, like I’m walking around with a really cheap mic in my hands. I don’t really use ANC, but using foam tips seemed to do more than the ANC on the linkbuds, and even with them I could still hear everything around me. In comparison, I don’t use the CX plus ANC because it works so well that I get paranoid about something possibly sneaking up on me.Battery life: Linkbuds S have a laughable battery life. With all the bells and whistles on I got about 2.25 hours, or 4 hours with everything off; both with the volume halfway. CX plus usually give me 6 with ANC on and 8 without at the same volume.APP/Features: Both the Linkbuds S and CX plus have wonky apps. Some stuff with both are a little fiddly. I am sure that’s probably true with most apps the way software is rushed out anymore. Both have things I don’t like. Linkbuds S I can have Transparency/ANC or one feature and off, but not all 3 even through there are open commands (maybe I’m doing something wrong here). The CX plus allows me to do all three. Multipoint is done the same way, but credit goes to the linkbuds here because I can change to different devices without having to have both buds out. The Linkbuds have a feature that, if activated, can pause audio and turn transparency on when you speak…nice, but it also activates when you cough, hum, or clear your throat which I apparently do constantly, so I ended up not liking this feature at all and kept it off.CXplus claim IPX7 to Linkbuds S’s IPX4. I’m not keen on testing either as I like my electronics dry.Linkbuds S have a smaller, more pocket friendly case, CX Plus has a case with more battery. Linkbuds have a slightly rough matte texture, CX Plus is shiny smooth plastic. Both are subjective and will come down to personal preference.I wish I had more buds to compare them to, but I’m cheap, so I don’t. Depending on what you’re after, these might be great for you (when on sale…a total rip at MSRP), but I returned them. Maybe the next generation will be better and I will be watching because they were pretty darn comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2022",AGWNPY4BDD4VATB6NV7W2BXOITHQ,True,34,Color: Black
R2RVAS25KM959D,B09YL76VSR,2.0 out of 5 stars They were the best of buds. They were the worst of buds.,doublePlusConsume,2,"In a word, these are inconsistent. Okay-ish on android. Intolerable on Windows 11. Bad for calls. Save money and buy more basic buds or another brand.Pros:- When they work, they sound quite good.- Very light weight- Pretty good fit for my small and assymetric ears. Have had one fall out when washing my face, but have stayed in otherwise, though I haven't tried running with them.- Decent for biking when I have a stocking cap over them (not too much wind noise).- Good customer support. I used the chat feature on the sony site. They stepped me through a reset (classic, I know), and it fixed a 'tinny' sound issue I was having on windows.- Ambient noise feature is sorta cool. It's sorta the opposite of noise cancelling and passes sound from the environment through. This is nice on a bike or when you're around people you might want to hear. Terrible for calls though.Cons:- Regardless of NC/AN settings in app, these pipe through ambient noise during calls. I talked to customer service and this is by design. (face palm). The result is any noise in the environment is on only piped through to your ears, but actually amplified, making calls very hard if there are medium or high level noises around. Also, those you are talking to hear it all as well. I pretty much always have to mute myself when I'm not talking during calls, which is obnoxious for one on one calls.- inconsistency #1: windows 11 sound quality ranges from normal to extra tinny. Anecdote. Was watching youtube with them on my laptop. Sound quality was good for 30 mins, then there was a blip, and they sounded extra tinny. I put them back in the case, took them back out. Still tinny. I re-installed the app on my phone to see if I could change a setting that would fix it. Factory Reset. No dice.- Noise cancelling doesn't really work for dynamic sound or loud environments. Tried using it in a cafe where they were using a mixer. Made my head want to explode. The app also doesn't tell you what mode you're in, so I actually just feel like I'm guess if I'm in ANC mode or ambient mode or normal mode. I've never owned anc headphones, so not sure if this is normal, but in anc mode, it feels like my ears are pressurized. Which, hell, they might be?! Using sound to fight sound (destructive interference), as ANC does, it plausibly increases the pressure between the buds and your ear drum. Not sure.- Also, ANC on windows 11 seems to be constantly toggling on/off every 10 - 40 seconds. Really, really obnoxious.- The app for android is quite complicated as it has to allow the management of many, many features. Sony might be biting off more than they can chew here... I would find it a challenge to enumerate the number of features they attempted to implement with these... I think it might introduce more issues than it solves. Sorta wish I'd bought a simpler pair of buds.- inconsistency #2: android app may cause inconsistent call experience. I use these for work calls I have each morning. The connection was really intermittent. Over my first 2 hours of using for calls, I'd say they disconnected on their own about 7 times... Sometimes briefly. Other times I had to go back into BT settings on my phone and reconnect... Ufta. I haven't had this problem since I uninstalled the app. (I reinstalled the app and may add a follow up to the review).TLDR.Good earbuds ruined by bad software.Super inconsistent and sound terrible (tinny) when connected to windows 11.On android, disconnects frequently during calls.If they are acting funny reset them by putting one bud in the case. Hold btn on case for ~25 secs (after 20 seconds light pulses for about five seconds. When light stopped pulsing (~5 secs) let go of btn.","Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2022",AHKVKCCEYHUOHUIDRJ4MGDCYXQAQ,True,5,Color: White
R2VW718GF8F6PX,B09YL76VSR,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great in theory, but doesn’t hold up",Hayden,2,"Edit to fix my grammarLong review. TLDR: ANC doesn’t work efficiently with constant wind noises blowing in left ear. Transparency sounds whiny, tinny, and almost unuseable. Shotty BT connection. Lack luster app. Sound is good, but only after tweaking the EQ. Switched back to my AirPod gen 1s. Pretty disappointed.So I’ve been using the AirPods 1st gen for about 5 years now. They have always been good, done me right, but they have been crapping out so I decided to look around for new ear buds.I did plenty research and everything came back to these. The price seemed right for what was being advertised. I got them, out of the box was cool, I knew it needed some tweaking, but not too bad. The Transparency was a bit whiny and tinny, but not unbearable. The sound was great, nice bass and what not but I did mess with the EQ a bit then got a nice sound. Audio enhancing, the ear forming schtick, all that fun stuff. This was the first day.The second day was when they were gonna be fully used, as I have my earbuds in almost all day at work, switching between listening to music/podcast, to just pausing the sound and forgetting they are there.Everything was cool, I was digging the transparency and having the podcast on at the same time, the ANC was satisfying. I was able to have a backpack leaf blower on and barely hear it. Of course, ANC was on, and I had my music near full blast. I didn’t do much physical activity that day, so they stayed in my ears well. After a while, I didnt notice them.But then comes the 2nd day. I’m getting ready for work, getting them on, and I notice the left ears transparency was far more intense than the right. The right felt normal, but the left felt like there was someone constantly blowing air into the mic. It was pretty jarring, but it was easily able to drown out in the music/podcast- with transparency on. But with the ANC setting on, it was near mind rattling.The ANC seemed like it didn’t do what it’s suppose to, like the Transparency mode was still active, but only in the left ear. The right felt as it was suppose to, but the left seemed to have no difference between ANC and Transparency.Only when I turned the ANC setting off, and just relied on the seal from the buds themself for the noise cancelling, that wind sound went away. This was the trouble shoot solution that SONY THEMSELVES recommended. Basically saying “just don’t use the ANC feature that you paid to get”Sure, easy fix, but the transparency still started to go, on top of the whiny and tinny sound. Which, the 2nd day, it was almost unusable as the voices came through way too intense and loud, with too much white noise being picked up.This day as well, I was doing some landscaping and was a bit more labor intensive but nothing crazy. These things would not stay in. I’d shove them in, get a solid seal, and then gradually they would fall out. I’ll give it the fact that I was making some hard movments as I was digging in dirt, but even later in the day, simple walking was making them want to fall out. I kept it going, giving them the benefit of the doubt maybe I need to change sizes, all that.I’m driving home, and decide to keep them both in so I can really break in the sound. But as I was driving, I kept having stuttering and quick disconnects. With my phone on my lap, the case in my pocket, I was getting real bad BT connection. Maybe it was the change of internet signals or whatever, if that’s even a factor. I ended up taking them out and using my car stereo because of how bad it got bad.Day 3 rolls around, and all the same issues. Constant heavy wind sound blowing through my left ear, which then eventually switched to the right. Same issues not staying in my ear, I changed buds and smalls were too small, and the large were too large. I suck it up, and keep using them for the day. Trying to mess with the settings and see what I can do. Nothing much able to change.Then My phone starts dying so I decide to plug it in, and keep it off my person, only about 20ft at most away from me at any time, and these things were stuttering and losing connection so bad. I was still within such close proximity to my phone and the case, outside of a building, no walls or anything to impede the connection, and I couldn’t get more then 10-15ft without connection problems. That was very frustrating. I should be able to have my phone within a more reasonable distance to keep a solid connection.I did go into the settings and re-prioritized the Connection Quality over Sound Quality, and that seemed to have made it even worst. This was after a full day of being generally uncomfortable wearing these.The app for these seemed really dated. I understand a BT headphone app not being super crazy innovative, but this one seemed hyped up with unnoticeable change. The added features such as the spatial audio, ear forming, auto voice detection, we’re all very lack luster.I was very excited to try these out and get something other than AirPods, but even after doing extensive research on Wireless Earbuds and came to these conclusions, I am very disappointed. If I’m paying a decent amount on ear buds that have all the bells and whistles, i want the bells and whistles. I didn’t buy ANC, Transparency, in-depth ear buds, to not even be able to use those features because they are just overall uncomfortable to use.I already issued a return, and went back to my old gen 1 AirPods. I am more than likely go for the AirPod Pro 2.This could all be subjective and personal issues with my specific device, but even with that, that calls for mad inconsistency and I’m over all very disappointed that after all my research, it came down to this.","Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2023",AEJFITBSWYHUHUFJ6X25V6YKJQKA,True,31,Color: Black

Prior to getting these Sony LinkBuds S, I was using a wired Bose ear pod which worked quite well but the cable was getting in the way and the wired connection to my phone was getting a bit wonky.These Sony LinkBuds S models are very comfortable and paired instantly with my Pixel 6 Pro. As with most products, you need to download a vendor specific app to update the software and complete the setup. Once all this was done, these ear buds are simply a matter of placing them in your ear and they ""just work"" as expected.The sound is pleasant though I see how this is a personal taste. Music plays fine and there have not been any complaints about sound quality or clarity on phone calls.The only complaint I have is around the various gestures required on each bud for different functions. One tap for this, two taps for that, etc. The most useful function to me was tapping on one ear bud for volume up and the other for volume down. I still have coordination issues of tapping the right spot on the ear bud.Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. They were a reasonable price and work well. The battery life is acceptable getting 5+ hours of continuous use. The charge can be topped off in a few minutes to get you another hour or more relatively quickly.

R1XJA49T6LJUU,B09YL76VSR,4.0 out of 5 stars Quite a Nice Pair of Noise-cancelling Earbuds,Amy,4,"These replaced my AirPods, which are a great product; their battery life was lessening, and there were some bluetooth problems with them, so I needed another pair. At the suggestion of a tech friend, I bought these.For the most part, I am very satisfied with their performance. They are comfortable, which wasn't what I expected when my friend told me that they're more intrusive in terms of how far they go into your ears. The sets of tips that accompany them are useful so that you can adjust their sizing.Using them is a breeze. It's obvious what the buttons and gestures do. Pairing them up to my devices was also a simple matter.I'm happy with the sound quality. I listen to both music and audio books, and these offer more than I expected.The noise cancelling is also quite good. This comes in handy because we have very loud neighbors, and I also use it on the bus when other passengers are yammering too much on their phones or blaring music through tinny phone speakers. Having three settings is nice; I used to have a headset that allowed you to turn noise canceeling either off or on.You'll probably be impressed with the battery life and how quickly they charge back up. I often have something playing for hours without an issue.These are not prone to slipping out, either of your ears or their case. I've dropped them a few times or knocked them off a table, and they stayed put, and I've never lost one while bending over or moving around.One major complaint: They do not provide any sort of Find My ability. The Apple AirPods do. If you drop one or both earbuds, assuming you've thought ahead and enabled Find My on an Apple device, they'll play a sound so you can locate what you've lost. These do not have this at all. I wish they'd add that feature. Fortunately, as I said before, they aren't prone to fall out very often, and if you do drop them, their shape makes them a bit less likely to bounce.There are a number of very good earbuds on the market. These are certainly well worth considering.","Reviewed in the United States December 12, 2023",AGWBTSZRFVPDWVAULXWNJO5H4KWA,True,2,Color: Black

R1LRNYGVPC12O8,B09YL76VSR,4.0 out of 5 stars Small eared humans- rejoice!,Katie Rausch,4,"I have been using my Skullcandy wired earbuds for as long as possible but it came time for me to find a true wireless earbud to wear to the gym/on the Peloton. I tried my husband’s AirPods and 1. They felt like they were going to fall right out of my head and 2. They hurt that little cartilage spot right before the ear canal entrance. Ppl with small ears… you know the spot I’m talking about! Instant pain and pressure spot. So we tried the other brand owned by Apple started by one Dr. Dre. Cool colors, but still hurt my sad little ears. The search continued…So I turned to Amazon, Reddit, Target, Best Buy, pouring over each review section in search of some clues for a review about each bud and their compatibility with small ears. Knowing that Sony is an old standby for most, I just went ahead and added them to the cart along with a Soundcore pair. The package arrived, the Souncore buds with stems hurt even more than the AirPods did. NEXT! The Sony packaging was fairly nice, recycled materials which I appreciated. Once I slipped them in **cue a chorus of Heavenly Host**. At last! A relatively secure earbud that didn’t hurt my ear cartilage! I downloaded the app and paired them to my phone and Peloton with just a tidbit of troubleshooting research. The sound coming through was almost as good as the Beats I tried. Certainly more than adequate bass for the size. The app has an equalizer option but right off the bat is was fairly well balanced for listening to Fred Again.. . Not too tinny at all. The touch commands are also intuitive! Touch the left bud and it changes from noise cancelling to ambient. Touch the right and it plays/pauses the music. I don’t have anything to say about talking on phone calls with them 🤷‍♀️ it’s just not what I need them for. I need them for exercise.Why I reduced a star: I really wish I could give it 4.5 stars honestly, and here’s why:1. The pairing wasn’t exactly intuitive. You have to have one bud in, have the other one in the case, have the case open and long press the case button to get it to pair to secondary devices (such as the Peloton).2. It makes a click when I’m running.3. The case just doesn’t have that satisfying heft that other bud cases have. And the plastic is rough feeling. Does that matter? Absolutely not. But if we’re rating overall experience it’s worth mentioning.So if you have small ears and have yet to find the right pair of true wireless earbuds, do yourself a favor and get these. Are they the best on the market? No. But they don’t hurt! And that’s the BEST selling point.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2023",AHXNVWCL76VTQPWCUPCBI74WVX7A,True,64,Color: Black

R28UN8C1AYN7QZ,B09YL76VSR,4.0 out of 5 stars Overall good set of earbuds,Ryan,4,"I have only ever used the original AirPods design since they came out. I enjoy how they can sit in my ears without causing them to hurt after prolonged listening. But they let in many sounds, and it's not worth using outdoors or in noisy conditions like a college dorm.So that is when I looked at Sony's LinkBuds S. They were on sale for around $148 at the time of purchase in August, and I sprung for the deal!The noise canceling is pretty decent; it's my first experience with ANC, but I was slightly underwhelmed. But I don't expect every sound to disappear at this price point.The Buds' sound is excellent and crisp. I personally noticed a little less bass when listening to music. Still, I downloaded the Sony app and tweaked the EQ settings to my style.When purchasing these, I was tempted to wait for AirPods Pro 2, but I needed something relatively new for college.The right side Bud does hurt my ear; I think it is because my right ear may be shaped differently. Not sure. I kind of ignore the uncomfortable feeling. I had another set of cheap silicone-tipped earbuds, and they did the same thing in my right ear, so I think this discomfort is just for me or other people with different shaped ears. And yes, I did try different silicone ear tips, but it didn't work. I might have to experiment with that a little more.The case and buds look very cool, especially with the mate feeling, unlike the AirPods case, which is slippery and scratches easily. I think you do not need an exterior case for the case, as it will barely show wear and tear.I'm very surprised by Sony's packaging. They created a box to use the space as much as possible. Very little to no plastic use, very cool, in my opinion. They are doing more than Apple or Samsung in the "" Eco-Friendly "" department in this technology era.Battery life is excellent, although I don't use them for that long anyways at a time. I don't walk everywhere with earbuds in my ears.Overall, I recommend these buds for people who may go between ""ecosystems"" like windows, iOS, etc. These buds can be paired to (but not connected to at the same time) up to 8 devices. Unfortunately, they do not offer multiple device support (connected to 2 or more devices simultaneously). This may be inconvenient, but switching between devices takes less than a second, but you have to do it manually.However, seeing the price back up near $200, my recommendation lessens. I would say go for it if they stayed at $140-$150. Not sure If I can recommend them when they are so close to AirPods Pro Gen 2 earbuds.But despite the price, good overall experience with my first Sony product. They will probably go down in price this year, hopefully.","Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2022",AGS6Z3I2JERIAJQXX3JDGXEUBL4Q,True,19,Color: Black

So I went down the rabbit hole dreading the emptiness the left behind. Tried the Anker Space A40 (made a hair dryer sound like a banshee ) and they have rad battery life, lightweight kind of awkward fit for me. Anker Space Q45—yes the over ear. The ANC is practically the same between these and the linkbuds s. So you decide on the 50H battery or the lightweight reduced sweat linkbuds. Anker Liberty 4, better ANC than space 40, but still had a weird pickup and extra background. Linkbuds S was better and similar price ($150 new) Plus the right side touch didn’t work so… Beats fit pro… this was closeeee. The ANC was just a smidge better. If I remember right it was the lower tones was a smidge better. The transparency was more natural on the beats, but boy did I like the light fit of the Sony. You could def get used to the fit of the wing of the beats. It was a more secure fit than the linkbuds s. But it just didn’t perform that much better to justify. Price was same at the time $150. I just liked the ANC on the Sonys a smidge more. This was a tough call and I wouldn’t fault you for going against me. Linkbuds s vs WF 1000MX4. I loved my MX4s. The ANC was the best and great audio. The fit and lightweight of the linkbuds s is superior. To the point where I will sacrifice the ANC difference. I can fall asleep on my side with them on (not desirable but much easier to do). The linkbuds s are just comfy!!! Light, smaller profile. Audio is good. ANC is just all most there. I do like the wireless charging of the wf100000mxxx4 case, but I didn’t realize it had until 3/4 of the way through ownership… The smaller case of the linkbuds is cooler too. I tend to wear and walk around town. So the case stays in my pocket, I drop in a store or bar, they charge and then I keep going. I did the same with the wf100xm45 but the linkbuds are more comfy in the pockets of my booty shorts. My only gripe is I need to find a/m tips to make the linkbuds 100. I’m using my wh100000mx4 tips, but my one ear just isn’t perfect. But that’s my anatomy.TLDR; linkbuds s compare to over ear anker q45 but are much more convenient. Wf1000mx4 are queen, but bulky like King Louie.","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2023",AEFAGRVZFYEJBHBTJ3T44HIZWVTA,True,17,Color: Black

Apparently I have freakishly small ear canals. Hard ear buds like airpods hurt like a mofo after being in place for any amount of time and every soft ear bud I have tried will literally fall out when I'm sitting still.These came up on a ""Best of"" earbud list for small ear canals and I decided to give them a go.

To be honest, I was trying to avoid paying more than 50 bucks, but after my third try, I knew that was a pipe dream.I think the combination of the smaller size and the fact they are lighter than most ear buds, these finally are the ones that stay put!!You do have to download a special app in order to get them to connect to your device - which is strange and kind of annoying - and sometimes the battery will just die without warning, but other than those two small complaints, I love these earbuds!

I can hear an improvement over my old ones. The problem is that the sound cuts out randomly. They are paired with a Pixel phone. I have had no problem in the past with Sony earbuds paired with a Pixel. I tried changing a few settings. Turned noise cancellation on and off. They still cut out periodically. They are also very sensitive when touching them for volume or to pause your music. At times they don't respond immediately when pausing and restarting music and I end up tapping them a few times and they stop and start back up. But the features do work.Battery life is ok but they and the charger don't seem to last as long as my WF-C500's. (Could be me. I have also left the buds out of the case a few times) I do like the size and shape of the charger though. It fits in my pocket more comfortably. The buds fit my ears fine but, of course, I can't speak as to how they will fit for others.Since I don't use them for long periods of time they are ok. I will deal with the cutting out.

R277HWU9CLEXCJ,B09YL76VSR,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, good noise cancelling.",M. M.,4,"Pros:* Solid sound reproduction - low treble, but the treble boost setting produces a reasonably flat sound curve for clear and distinct audio.* Good noise cancelling - not best in class, but sufficient in most environments even with the included silicone tips. Swapping to third party sound isolating foam tips would no doubt improve things, but unlike some other earbuds I own, I haven't felt the need.* Supports high bitrate audio (LDAC)* Recharges from the case very quickly.* Light and comfortable long-term.Cons:* Battey life could be better - using noise cancellation and LDAC (which are both power hungry) drops bettery life to 3-4 hours. Luckily it changes fast in the case, but still wish it was better. Can me improved by changing codec or disabling noise cancellation.* Only supports LDAC for high bitrate. AptX Adaptive is less prone to dropouts and consumes less power to process, and aptX HD, which more of a lateral move, would be good to see too for wider overall support.Other notes:Using a low bitrate codec like AAC really does improve battery life and connection stability over LDAC - I tend to select it in noisy environments when I might not be able to appreciate the subtle improvement anyways.Case is slim, light, and slightly textured, but still a bit slippery. Comfortable to carry in a side pocket, but the door feels a little flimsy and I don't know if it would survive being sat on in a back pocket (also a little too large to be comfortable to sit on for that matter) so I would avoid back pocket storage.","Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2023",AFUYU4NDZUGXCQ47362W7F3DLC3A,True,2,Color: Earth Blue
R2OGZA9EQA78TK,B09YL76VSR,"3.0 out of 5 stars Fine, I guess. Fine.",ihsan,3,"These new mid-grade earbuds from Sony get fantastic pro reviews. Source after source states that they compete favorably with the WF-1000XM4 / 5, but at half the price or less. And so, I tried them out to replace my 1000XM4s.I tried them for one day.Positive thoughts:They are light -- very light! As a result, they were comfortable to wear, which I can't say about the bigger 1000-series line (even the new XM5s). The battery life seemed to be amazing. I wore them for many hours, and was still around 90% when I was finished.Negative thoughts:The sound quality and ANC is a definite step below the 1000-series. They did an amazing job inside my living room -- the music sounded rich, and the world was dead calm. But once I got them out on my nighttime walk, I found the ANC very weak in the mid-range -- passing cars were barely muted. Higher frequency ambient noise (a sound-walled freeway I come within 1/8 mile of) was almost negligibly different on ""Noise Cancelling"" mode versus ""Ambient Sound 20"". That's ... clearly not working right.I kept hearing this buzz that accompanied voices in my audio lesson, coming from my left earpiece. It was distracting, so I switched to music. Then the buds starting skipping, cutting out, and producing scratchy interference. It got worse and worse for 10 minutes before I just turned them off, and walked home in silence. This was on the latest firmware and software.Verdict:I probably got a malfunctioning unit. But while these aren't as expensive as the 1000-series, they aren't really a ""budget"" offering in the sector -- quality control is still important. I was soured, and Amazon's generous return policy allowed me to try other offerings while the holiday sales were still in full swing.Take a chance if you wish. Maybe they're really good, and all my troubles were rooted in poor luck.

R231GTT5IER8ER,B09YL76VSR,4.0 out of 5 stars Sounds Great for $158,RyceBall,4,"I've been eyeing these buds since they were released but was hesitant to purchase them due to the mixed reviews for the ANC, even with the initial launch discount. That said, my new neighbors are frat boys who party at any hour and are destroying my night-shift body's minimal sleep schedule. And, while I do have noise canceling technology (Bose Headphones), they aren't devices that one can wear comfortably in bed. As such, I decided to bite the bullet when these buds went on sale on Prime Day for $158.Having worn these now for a few hours, I'll share my current thoughts: - ANC is far from sub-par. You might notice a decrease in quality if you're used to the high-end stuff, but if you're like me and your only experience with NC are headphones that create pressure on your ears, this is certainly a worthy purchase. The Sony app is still learning to adjust (it has only been a few hours after all) so I'll sometimes hear my fan on full blast if I move locations, but the earbuds adjust and make the fan noise completely vanish within about 15 seconds. - I consider myself to have ears on the smaller scale (I'm 5'1"") and am usually skeptical of earbuds that have a round body. That said, these have not yet caused any ear pain and the Medium ear tips (these are the tips that are on the earbuds when you open the box) had a fairly comfortable fit. After a few hours, I decided to try the Small ear tips and realized that they were the better fit for the fact that the earbud bodies sat more snugly in my ears and didn't protrude as much. Unfortunately, I found that the Small tips were a tad too small for my ears as the NC could no longer completely block out the sound of my fan. After about 5-10 minutes of bouncing between the Medium and Small tips, I decided to stick with the Medium tips since NC was of better quality. And it's not like I'm worried about the buds falling out of my ears. - Charging is fairly simple, both for the buds and the case. I did notice that some folks here were upset about the lack of wireless charging but, as a cat parent, I find the ability to charge my case via a secure cable extremely reassuring.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2022",AHOITHGYFO27PCLD3BHGJ6HJDYNQ,True,11,Color: Black
R3IR36RC9XGR1M,B09YL76VSR,2.0 out of 5 stars Review after 16 months,Patrick Frembs,2,"Overall, I liked the sounds quality and the ANC.Being able to only use the right ear bud when I want to use only one is rather annoying (I can't just switch to the right one when the battery dies but rather have to put the left one back in the case and wait for it to be charged again). That also resulted in the right ear bud battery overall becoming weaker than the left ear bud. Too many ear buds out there let you use the left and right one individually.Why I would not recommend these ear buds to anyone is the clicking/popping sounds in my right ear bud.First I thought it was moisture (while working out) but I have been having this popping for weeks now and after doing some research, this seems to be more common than I would like for these Sony ear buds.It seems to be an issue with the seal rings and pressure that it just keeps releasing pressure and make this popping sound (regardless of whether the buds are on or off - always the same popping sounds).I reached out to Sony and in polite words, they basically said ""you're on your own with this issue"".When I asked if I can send them to them to fix them, they only sent me a link to a 3rd party (none Sony) company that I can send my earbuds to and they can maybe look at it and fix it - or not.....After researching, this popping sounds seems to be quite an issue (just google ""Sony Linkbud S clicking sound"" and do your own research before you spend a fair amount of money on buds that seem to have a design issue that can't be solved.It's unfortunate that I had to trash these after 16 months.I just bought the Bose Quietcomfort Earbuds II (bought from Bose directly as Amazon customer service these days is about as helpful as Sony) and I couldn't be happier.If you end up buying the Sony, I hope they work for you and don't end up causing issues down the road!I used to like Sony but especially after the customer service acknowledge the issue and was very quick to understand the issue and yet not helping me in any way (and I don't mean helping as in paying to fix it or sending me new ones) but rather pushing me towards some 3rd party company to deal with them - no thank you Sony.There are way better ear buds and customer service out there for this amount of money.","Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2024",AFDWO5BGZ4B3TZWQUUAEEZ2MNM2Q,True,1,Color: White

The Sony Buds though are exactly what I was looking for. Compact, good sound, good noise cancelation, and I like the non button controls. I use these at night in bed and they are fantastic. My only minor gripe is the battery life seems a little lower than others. This is a very minor complaint being how compact they are, and they still last more than long enough 99% of the time.","Reviewed in the United States February 6, 2024",AESANEQAJSDYF3VXC3NR2NJ5PCPQ,True,0,Color: White

I had never given these a second thought because I assumed they were as big as previous Sony earbuds, but after giving them a try, I cannot believe that I didn't try them sooner! These fit perfectly, they don't cause pain, they stay in through talking/eating/moving around, and I have been completely impressed by these earbuds. I highly recommend! The sound is excellent, love the transparency mode.

RUHC3GGD8FXOO,B09YL76VSR,2.0 out of 5 stars Intentionally Missing Featured for Being a Cheaper Model,Kindle Customer,2,"I originally bought Sony's WF-1000XM5 Earbuds at retail price. They sounded amazing and the noise cancelling was superb -- Only issue was, no matter the tips, it simply would not fit in my head.I read some Reddit accounts of different earbuds and found that people said the Linkbuds S have a far better fit, so I bought them on sale and returned the XM5's. They were absolutely correct, and they fit perfectly. But now, since it's a cheaper model, it has arbitrary restrictions such as the controls not being combined into one setting [ Can't adjust volume + music and ambient noise like you can with the XM5's ], or not having spotify / music service buttons despite having a CPU powerful enough to run real-time DSEE [ Compression reversal ] whilst cancelling noise.I don't get it. there is nothing stopping them from being as usable as the XM5's, yet they choose to screw over the consumer anyways. As for sound quality, it's way too bassy and cancels the mids to an uncomfortable level. If you want to make it better with software, don't use the built-in EQ -- The autoEQ on wavelet runs circles around Sony's software for any type of music.Bottom line, they're worth it if they're on sale, but I wouldn't get these at retail price. They have sales fairly often, though, and I ended up getting my pair for about $120.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AFV264U2LEMTWYQBF4DGJEWUA7YA,True,0,Color: Black
R3664USQ1A8NAM,B09YL76VSR,4.0 out of 5 stars Not for cyclists or bikers,Alex R.,4,"This review is for cyclists and bikers wondering if it cancels the wind noise. No, it doesn't. No current ANC technology does. I tried it both on my bicycle and motorcycle. I tries to combat the outside noise - way better than anything else on the market - other than the over the ear headphones like Sony's top of the line XM4 I have, which obviously wouldn't fit under either (cycling or motorcycle) helmet. Yes, you can crank up the volume, but what the point? They will cancel noise if you ride below 75mph. Let's skip the legalities, because driving or even riding a bicycle with earphones is as illegal, as speeding, though you really need to piss off the cop (with something else) to get a ticket for that. Safety-wise I rely on my eyes and mirrors - another reason why you won't find any cycling or helmet headset or earphones that cancels all the outside noise. No corporation would want that liability.Other than the two specific applications above I bought the earphones for, it excels in the sound quality, comfort, and the ANC department. One thing that truly stands out is the transparence mode. It beats Earpods Pro and the likes by a large margin. So if noisy city apartment or annoying coworkers is your kind of issues, go for it.As far as the battery life everyone complains about, it's no better or worse than other LDAC-capable earphones like my Soundcores - which offer an even better sound quality w/o the ANC.","Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2023",AGFH3NZDGE7MTETNXE5XVULZLJIQ,True,8,Color: Black
R8761LOCNG8AT,B09YL76VSR,4.0 out of 5 stars Good At Almost Everything,Wesley M.,4,"The design on these is excellent in my opinion. Their not so big and therefore not too heavy which makes wearing them for long periods of time no problem at all. The fit will of course be different for everyone, but in my case these don't slip off my ears what so ever. The case and earbuds themselves have a matt grippy texture on them, which definitely help prevent drops when taking them in or out of pockets and placing them in or out of ears.The default sound on these will please those that are into bass dominant music, and while vocals aren't excellent, they are still exceptional. There is also a companion app by Sony on the App Store and Play Store to configure the sound more to one's preference.My ears do find that these can get loud if needed. For times like these, it might be a good idea trying out the noise cancelling feature before blowing your ears out. I'm surprised how effective noise cancelling can be when in crowded events like wedding parties. Transperency mode makes it possible to hear someone without taking off the earbuds by doing one simple tap. This works just fine when indoors, but in windy environments it is better just taking off the earbuds completely because wind noise gets amplified when in transperency mode.Overall these Sony earbuds are great. Just wish the microphones were slightly better, and for voices to sound more natural during transperency mode.The option for other colors like silver or burgundy would have been cool too.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2023",AEG4OWU6OOPLR7G7YRN6ZKWECC6A,True,4,Color: Black

They far outstrip any competition in all aspects and are genuinely just the best earbuds at this price point.

I have an iPhone but wanted to move away from Apples ecosystem and have always had an appreciation for Sony products. The Beats solo's that I have are okay on sound quality but wanted something better. Sony headphones have the reputation of have the best acoustics of all the mainstream headphone makers.The fit of the earphones are good, occasionally will have to twist the earbuds to get a good seal but, they stay inside the ear and having had them fall out yet. Unlike Apple headphones, Sony comes with a app with an equalizer that allows you to further custom the sound quality. And the sound quality was everything that was said about these earbuds. For the size and price of what they are you can really hear things that my Beats leaves mumbled.The case is light with a very textile feel to it and the battery life is very good when paired with the earphones and quickly charges.One of the negative points is that when played on the iPhone the Bluetooth is a bit weak and will cut of one or both channels. It doesn't do this when using my Macbook Pro, so non Apple products my not work optimally using the iPhone.Overall very happy with my purchase and would buy from Sony again.","Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2023",AHAOH7MKK7EPCNMOZZ7TXE7L6O2A,True,9,Color: Black

R37F6TWDEWSOA4,B09YL76VSR,"3.0 out of 5 stars Feels good, but only for a moment.",Rudy,3,"So, a few key things to say about this product, and how I use it. This rating is purely based on my experience with it.On my end, first, I went with a refurbished version. Second, I'll easily use them 8-12 hours a day, definitely more than some people. 3rd, I'm often in somewhat louder environments.How have these Sony earbuds held up? A few weeks in, I have had some serious issues with the noise cancelling aspect. Sometimes, one or both earbuds will give loud, high pitched, static or feedback. The only thing that seemed to 'fix' that issue is by putting both bids back into the case to reset them. The other option is actually to turn the noise cancelling off in the app. I'd say that's the biggest issue.A somewhat minor problem is, the app almost gets in the way more than it helps. I cannot leave the Adaptive Sound Control on, as it changes my settings too often. I prefer to use the Ambient Sound Control (single tap) option, but then you cannot turn off noise cancelling altogether to fix the giant feedback issue. Not really as important is the battery life. Often, I will only get 5 hours in before having to charge them. If I could run noise cancelling on, it actually extends battery life by being able to turn the volume down. Issues have arisen there, however.I actually Really like how quickly they charge, though. Really did great there. The equalizer included within the app feels decent enough, and the sound is about as good as I've heard.In all, I do not know if I would say these were worth the money I spent on them. Some issues may have been the fact I went with refurbished, but if it is certified refurbished, then that's Sony endorsed. If they don't want me complaining about issues on a refurbished product, tighten those reins. If they chopped the full price for new ones in half (closer to $100-$110), I'd definitely go for them.","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2022",AEXCSIBUIRP3RCKPCY5H3HOG2EQQ,True,1,Color: White

The earbuds are so comfortable, and the new multipoint connection feature makes them so much better. Switching audio between devices is just brilliant and on demand. You don't have to have the same manufacturer's equipment for it to work like Samsung or Apple multipoint solutions. You can connect any manufacturer's device. There appears to be more tweaks to this update than just multipoint. The mids and bass seem a bit improved using existing EQ settings. I am not seeing any difference in battery usage connecting one vs two multipoint devices.The range of my bluetooth seems improved and I'm keeping connections further away than before the update. LDAC seems to be the biggest drain on battery as before. LDAC does work with multipoint if the source you are currently listening to supports LDAC. I tend to switch to LDAC when listening to music and AAC (big battery saver) for podcasts, videos. Using transparency or noise cancellation vs ANC off seem less battery intensive than before the update.My only beef is that I wish there was a smarter way to designate specific apps to use LDAC vs AAC or other codecs vs having to manually change it every time. I have two pair and have not seen any battery drain or uneven battery usage between the L or R as has been reported. Just one glitch I'm noticing is when I disconnect one pair and connect the other. Previously, it just happened. Now it is quicker when I go to the Headphones app and manually switch to the other set. After the switch, it reconnects just as easily as before and reconnects to multipoint connections quickly.Correction - I can be listening to LDAC on Tidal and pause it, play a video off my laptop and it switches automatically from LDAC to AAC and back to LDAC when I pause the laptop and go back to Tidal on my phone.

Specifically assigning functions only to one ear bud or the other, requiring both to be mostly functional. I end up using just the right ear most of the time as it is the “touch to respond” or “play/pause” functions, with the noise cancelling being assigned only to the right. With my premium pair of apple AirPods I can do both from both and alternate between each ear piece. Sony any apple could easily make these functions universal between both premium and budget pairs they just choose to make one influence the other.If I didn’t own a pair of the expensive earbuds I probably would be blissfully unaware of the intentional drawbacks of these.","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2023",AFNAIPXQFB4IRL7G2ZQKKJAZ3G5Q,True,1,Color: Black

The Sony's sound is alright, its pretty good, but because the buds don't sit well in my ear, and don't stay seated as my jaw moves around, the sound and the ANC often fall short of what is promised. The bass isn't terribly powerful, and I found that coming off the daily use of my JBLs I had to mess with the Sony EQ to get comparable sound and bass out of them.

I'll review the app and screenshots if I find any.App: I'm not thrilled that I had to connect via their app. However, I haven't tried disconnecting them either. The one thing I couldn't stand from their app is the Talk setting. Makes sure that's off when listening to music or otherwise your heavy breathing, a slight cough will pause the music and that's annoying.Battery: I've used these a for a few days and every time I come back from a walk they go right back in the case. So battery life isn't a problem for me right now. Nor would I worry about it. Unless you're on a two day hike in the Sahara with out an outlet. Then I'd start to worry.Price: To me, these plugs don't warrant the price. I think they're overly priced for what they are. Sony had wired in ear plugs back in the early 90s I think it was and those were 20x better than these. I believe they cost me around $29 I still have them somewhere in a box too.Final: I love Sony headphones. Always have. These aren't that great. Sony can so better.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2022",AHJQIGTJHL26ADD53JMFRPCZRTGQ,True,2,Color: Black

They give great noise cancelling which helps the audio to sound more full. The earbuds themselves don't last too long since I use them basically all day but the case fixes that problem with charging the buds.I had lost one of the earbuds and I had to pay $115.00. After receiving it from the facilitiy (cause you have to send them your earbud and the case and pay for shipping which for me was $20.50) then the earbuds kept having connectivity issues to one another like every 5 mins. The best thing to do if you lose a bud is to just buy the earbuds again and to just trash your old ones.,"Reviewed in the United States September 19, 2023",AGFMVFZJMHR6MYE4S5WPNMUXKRAA,True,1,Color: Black

The connectivity is solid, the sound is great, they fit well in my ears and are very comfortable. The charging case works well and the magnetic feature helps keep the earbuds in place.However, as of April 2024, I cannot recommend them. The battery life, particularly in my right earbud, has diminished dramatically. I started noticing issues in February, and they have gotten much worse. I have maybe an hour of life in the right earbud if I'm in calls and around 1.5 hours for just listening. The battery life in the Jabra 65t is still strong after 5 years.Sony provides a 1 year warranty and it seems like the battery was designed to fail after the warranty period passed.

R2QUT3N3LXNQF8,B09YL76VSR,5.0 out of 5 stars INCREDIBLE bang for the buck,Time2Fly,5,"First the bad news... only one thing, these last generation buds do not have a way to control the volume ON the ear bud, rather you are still toggling the volume on the side of your phone. OTHER than that:NOISE CANCELLATION is incredible (e.g., mowing the lawn reduces the noise of the mower to a faint hum, in the gym you're basically working-out in a vacuum, and the noise cancellation can work on top of your music which wasn't always the case with buds). REFURBISHED doesn't always mean junk, there are reviews where people maybe had defective buds, not me, mine work just fine. SOUND is rich, deep bass, with very clear vocals and mids. They are not quite AS rich as the Bose, however, the sound on these are worth every penny- aweome sound! I had a pair of the new Bose but returned them as they are rather large/bulky for 2022 buds- the Sony's are very small. WATER PROOF, my last JBL's died likely because of my workouts and some moisture over 4 years of continuous use. These Sony's have already been drenched in sweat and they still perform and act like new. CONNECTIVITY - never an issue, always connected on my Google 3 and now my new Google 7 Pixels. FIT- perfect fit, never fall out! ENDURANCE is great, I have yet to wear these to the limit but they are as advertised in the charging and speed.END OF THE DAY, I'd take these over any of the others buds (and I did). Sony was the Mercedes of audio/visual brands in the 70's & 80's and up to today and they're STILL 'banging-out' hits!","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2023",AEU4OTTG7CJLA2645WUJTJCA2DOQ,True,1,Color: Black

You're supposed to tap the left earbud to switch between Awareness mode and Noise Cancelling mode but to be honest, I don't notice a difference. I'm not a connoisseur of sound quality either so I can't speak much for that, but nothing sounds bad to me.My only complaint is that they auto-pause whenever you take one or both out of your ears.

The battery just dies after 25-30 mins of usage, while the other side is just fine. It seems like this is a common problem when I did a quick google search, and Sony suggested I buy a single side earbud for undisclosed amount of money on top of $60 of resyncing fee (?) and shipping, which considering the price point of this product, it doesn't make much sense. Although I understand this is out of warranty, but I expected more use out of a product that is not cheap. I guess I'll just buy another brand since I have no other choice.

I find they require a lot of adjustment while walking or running, and this is somewhat annoying compared to other earbuds that lack noise canceling but seal pretty well for me. I had some trouble with them falling out but not as much as just maintaining the noise canceling seal. This will depend on your ear shape though, so as long as the shape works for you these are great.The LinkBuds S support SBC, AAC, and LDAC when connected to an Android phone. Bluetooth LE Audio with the LC3 codec is supposed to be added in an update which could be one of the first headphones to support the new codec but at the time of my review this feature is not available yet.Sound quality is decent but I found it still sounds too compressed regardless of codec choice with an Android phone as the source.

This is the only set of earbuds that ever felt completely comfortable to me. The noise cancelling was impressive for earbuds. The ambient sound was excellent, especially if you're on a flight, train, etc listening for announcements. The sound quality was exceptional as well. Call quality and microphone noise cancelling was incredible! I could wear these in the garage next to a straight piped (no silencing or smog equipment) engine being revved up loud enough to hurt people ears and the only thing the microphone picked up was my voice.The application allows for even more control of the earbuds and gives you many additional options to tinker with.So why is it 1 star? After about a year of use I was still using these daily and would get about 3 hours of battery life, give or take depending on use case. I updated to the latest firmware and I now hear the low battery warning after 5 minutes and the earbuds will entirely shut off within LESS than 10 minutes. There is no way to roll back the firmware at the moment, any many others have reported similar issues after updating the firmware. Also many have been told by Sony it's a battery age issue and denied replacement.Going from 3 hours to 5 minutes does not happen to batteries overnight. Updating the firmware somehow caused this and Sony has not fixed it. I have tried resetting the device as well as a variety of other troubleshooting attempts with zero results. These are now reduced to little more than a paperweight, which, given their lightweight nature means they are also bad at that.Do not buy until Sony resolves the firmware issue and if you did buy them, do NOT update your firmware.","Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2024",AF6ALGCQDBJBQVT3UC3TPRHQLWVQ,True,2,Color: Earth Blue

I honestly barely notice they're there sometimes, I've almost gotten in the shower with them in 3 times since buying them this last month.I'm not crazy on noise canceling in general, I use it for hearing protection when I'm using power tools like grinders and sds drills and they definitely work better than ear plugs, they also manage to not get dusty somehow during rough in work. Mowing the lawn I can clearly listen to podcasts without missing what someone says. But I suppose if you're REALLY that worried about it you could get some foam ear tips, but I suspect that would ruin their perfect comfort.And while I've dropped them twice, I'm partially convinced that they're so light the impact doesn't induce as much shock.They're incredibly comfortable, sound great, I recharge the case every other night (I'll never understand people who complain about a 24hr case charge), and I got them for $150...

Either sound plays louder in the left ear, phase seems out of phase, or the bass drivers stop working - the last time for 2 days only to play for a few hours and go out again.I have a lot of JBL gear and I thoroughly love the brand. Sadly, this item, in particular, has been problematic. JBL return process has been amazing. They are taking back a set I've had for a year but this is 3 sets in one year that's not worked properly and it is super frustrating. So no hard feelings to the company. I love JBL, I am a huge fan of their stuff but these I can no longer recommend ONLY because the build quality is not made to last and work properly and the fit is temperamental in my ears. I have a set of AKG that fit much better and are more comfortable. I prefer the sound of the JBL but having to send them back for the 3rd time I am asking them to just give me a JBL credit.I am sorry to anyone who bought these based on my recommendation and had issues that I have.Update 4 (10/6/2023) I am loving these. In ways I like them better than my all-time faves the Sennheiser HD600 open back headphones. Totally different though: these are musical with rock and pop that I listen to, the HD600 are analytical and detailed. But I love these buds! Bass is really strong but not obnoxious. I hope they don't phase these out. At $50, they were a great deal. Almost wanted to buy the blue when it was available for $50 but I got 2 pair of the black. Great buds! JBL rocks! And I am an audiophile.Update 3: Received a replacement from JBL within 7 days of shipping my broken pair back after going through a chat now and explaining the problem on the JBL website. Not much grief given, honestly, took about 15 minutes. JBL charged me nothing and made the return fairly simple. I had to deliver them to the UPS store which stunk. I was sent a code to my phone for the UPS personnel to scan since I had no printer. UPS taped up the box.Update 2: On day 16, the Left earbud stopped playing as loud as the right. The left is playing too low. Now, I am having to deal with JBL to return them.Update: I lost a medium eartip. I contacted JBL and they sent me replacements within 3 days at no charge. Good customer service!The medium tips are now working well and I get seals much easier now.I notice some bass noise coming in with heavy burst of wind - denoting the authenticity RTINGS mentions - that there is low end the buds can't hide - particularly heavy wind in the mics.Loving the sound. I did buy another set! Love these buds.Also, there is a find-my-buds feature on the app that will have the buds emit a loud pitch in case you misplace or drop the bud.Ladies and Gentlemen, these buds are a TKO for $50. JBL always with the impressive prices for the quality you get IMO!When I search for audio products my search is sound-focused and dutiful (to do what I need them for). I use earbuds while I work. I am sad that I am having to replace a set of Samsung Galaxy Pro buds that lasted me over 2 years and were still going strong until I washed and dried them. Now, I am having to replace (the buds survived but the case did not). Those Samsung NGL were great buds and the JBL is going to have trouble impressing me. I was going to get the Samsung GB 2 Pro but the price and considering I lose and/or break earbuds or the earbuds fail-to-work fairly regularly, I'm not spending $200 on earbuds. I honestly don't understand why earbuds are still so high? Must be a fixed market? I wasn't impressed at first with the JBL 130. I was missing my Samsung, considerably, and feeling more sick for having wasted them. I thought the JBL were ok but were going to get annoying, probably soon, but I tried to be patient and allow some adjusting playthrough time. I voiced to my friend about the ""JBL sound"" - I thought the bass was too boosted and the treble sounded spiked / tingy in a certain frequency and lacking the top-end highs, like there was roll-off. I felt, also, that the mid-range was recessed. It's been three days and now I am jamming! I'm literally shocked: I don't know if my ears changed or the buds broke-in or if it just took some getting used to but I honestly think the sound has morphed. At first, everything had that annoying bass bleed that drives me crazy! I cannot tolerate hummy bass, or standing bass waves. Today, I noticed the bass seems like a low atmospheric concert sound and is tight and there is very little bass bleed that I am noticing - it is very tolerable, if not almost perfect! We got some very strong bass, but guess what, everything else is keeping up now! The highs now seem more mellowed in the tingy range and extending higher. I am noticing the different types of high hats. The mid-range has a good strong attack and clean - the tonal balance feels slightly warm but well detailed - like a concert. They aren't critical listening and as detailed as my Sennheiser HD600 but all of the details were there. These make rock music feel more alive, punchy and blazing guitars and lifelike vocals. RTINGS did a good job of rating these buds and leading me to them. JBL makes more concert speakers than any brand in the world and these feel like JBL did this set of earbuds right!Pros:Sound Quality - it maybe a ""fun"" sound but it is definitely enjoyable and pleasing this picky listener with everything I have thrown at it. Probably not the most delicate but great for my heavier rock stuff. Rap, pop and Christian music had enjoyable balance, too.Charging - lasts for days! I was charging my Samsung Galaxy Buds everyday. If your battery life on your earbuds is crap, these here are excellent!Noise Cancelling - I think the NC in these buds are stellar but confused me at first. I was reading they have NC with Smart Ambient which basically means they let through some higher frequencies. It was off-putting at first but this still lets me hear enough to be ""safe"" but blocks enough noise that you can wear these while driving or taking a shower and it drowns out the noise. I was amazed at how well JBL designed the NC to simultaneously make a good NC system and allowing in sounds that help me hear shoppers, voices, or other higher frequency accidents. It's like voodoo to me but I've never used anything NC before to compare it other than my Walker Razers (gun shooting / mowing headphones). I think the NC of the 130 is underrated because it is a hybrid form of Noise Cancelling. But if you want to drown out all higher frequencies these might disappoint.Connectivity - so far these things connect effortlessly and quickly.Voice Calls - has worked great so far!JBL app - worked just fine but I don't need it.Price - at $50, relative to other buds with similar sound quality, these are probably the best deal there is.Shipping - Amazon delivered on their promise to get these here in 1-day. Worth mentioning.ConsFit - I have a hard time getting these pointed in my earholes correctly and to get them to seal. They feel loose no matter which tip I use unless I do get a really good seal, and that seal can sometimes come undone. It seems to me like the earbuds themselves do not touch the lobe in any way, which forces the entire seal on the eartips, which doesn't seem like a great design to me. Further I did have some issues.Eartips - The smalls were so small they won't stay in. The mediums don't hurt my ears but a little smaller than I wish they were but they work ok. The large hurt my ears some after a few hours and they made the buds stick out from my ears even more. They stick out pretty drastically I feel like but not as silly looking as stick models.They Stick Out - this doesn't bother me much. I got the black and think they look cool in my ears but some people will probably only want buds that hide better. With the large tips they stick out past my ear lobe, but with medium they don't go past my entire outer ear but they are still out there a lot further than my old Samsung.I am strongly considering buying another pair while they are $50. I feel like this is a sweet price for buds of this caliber.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2023",AEIYWQILFQWQ5FGHLGBFJTZPKOJQ,True,93,Color: Black
R27YC0PA5WJWP9,B09JB8KPNW,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sounding Buds at a Great Price,SFNY,5,"These are possibly the best ear buds you can buy for your money. First, download the JBL Headphone app. From there pairing is effortless. Please note: you can not operate these buds without app.Once you are in the app and pair, there are customizable equalizers for your listening preference. You can also make your own, which is what I did.I noticed some comments about the lack of bass, so I wanted to address this for you. There are 4 sizes of comfortable rubber ear buds. For maximum sound quality with any ear bud, you do not use the size that fits perfectly in your ear. If you do, this is where sound degradation occurs. You must use the pair (generally the largest) so it creates a seal or suction within your ear once pushed in. Notice the rubber ear bud retracts if you were to push down on it. This is what prevents sound leakage once you place into your ear.You won't be disappointed if you follow these simple steps. All the best!!","Reviewed in the United States November 14, 2023",AEJ7HSULCNIWEMDBQB2MJPKSL5AQ,True,22,Color: Black
R2LPFDTYS8FWYG,B09JB8KPNW,"4.0 out of 5 stars Feature Rich for the Price, Acceptable Performance",A. Voris,4,"I bought these to help filter out noise at the office generally for music listening. I will split the review into three section: Noise Cancelling, Sound Quality, and Other.Noise Cancelling:They will work for some people but not all. At the home office they work great, they filter out the frequency of noise produced by computer fans. However, I don't believe the noise cancelling is all that adaptive, rather it is just filtering a fixed number of frequencies. For example, the higher frequency noise from my air purifier is still noticeable, but dampened. This seems to be the case with all noise. I would expect their algorithm is doing something like filtering out the average frequencies in the average environment so overall you do indeed get a quieter listening experience. ̶I̶ ̶f̶i̶n̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶""̶A̶m̶b̶i̶e̶n̶t̶ ̶A̶w̶a̶r̶e̶""̶ ̶s̶e̶t̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶q̶u̶i̶e̶t̶e̶s̶t̶.̶ (UPDATE: Meant to say ANC (duh) slightly confusing what mode I was in based off of the quick start manual. Ambient would be if you wanted to hear more than if the ANC was just off.) For the price this is very acceptable. The more adaptable, on the fly noise cancelling algorithms are extremely difficult to implement, and hence you pay a premium for them. Overall, I would compare these to a really good pair of foam tip IEMs in terms of noise cancellation. These will definitely not provide any hearing protection for things like shooting, loud shop work, etc... so keep that in mind and use your head.Sound Quality:These are definitely a ""consumer grade"" listening experience, which for most people won't be a bad thing. For the price I am indifferent. I would say the bass is higher than normal with more muted/muddy treble. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and I would say most people would find them ""good"". For what they cost, the sound exactly like what I would expect, better than a 20 dollar pair of headphones and not as good as a $150 dollar pair of IEMs, but your mileage may vary. For comparison with a competitor, I have some Sony wf-c500 wireless earbuds (no ANC) and these sound roughly the same, maybe slightly less clear treble and bass. I would still pick these over the Sony's because these have more features for the price and for other reasons I will list below.Other:Battery -- I think the battery life specs are roughly accurate, I get a full day on them, but haven't really pushed them to the 40 hours though. Battery life seems great, the case seems to get you maybe 2 charges. The case is nothing special, I wish the hinge had more tension in it like the Sony's so it felt more premium, I can kind of wiggle it a little bit but definitely not a deal breaker. I have yet to run them to the point where they alert you if they are low just once or they keep doing it. If they keep doing it I will update and remove a star because I don't quite understand why you would annoy the user with a message consistently for the last X% of battery (original rating is 4 stars).Size and Eartips -- these are rather large, but acceptable given the price and feature set. They don't fit in the ear as well as the Sony ones do but they don't seem to fall out either. The Sony design fits into the ear better and ""hugs"" it so to speak, they seal better as well. I do really wish these came with a set of foam tips, they would actually compete in a different price bracket for that much, mainly because of the noise reduction. They would also help the fit. The included silicon ear tips are like the cheapest on the market, not as supple as more premium earbuds. There's nothing inherently wrong with them but they may rip after a while. I think if JBL addressed the fit (decrease the depth of the ""body"" in the ear so they seal better since there would be less weight pulling down on the eartip) and eartips they'd have an extremely solid 50 dollar pair of earbuds.Controls - ̶U̶n̶l̶e̶s̶s̶ ̶I̶'̶m̶ ̶m̶i̶s̶s̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶i̶t̶,̶ ̶I̶ ̶d̶i̶s̶l̶i̶k̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶t̶r̶o̶l̶s̶ ̶d̶o̶ ̶n̶o̶t̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶v̶o̶l̶u̶m̶e̶ ̶a̶d̶j̶u̶s̶t̶m̶e̶n̶t̶,̶ ̶m̶a̶s̶s̶i̶v̶e̶ ̶m̶i̶s̶p̶l̶a̶y̶ ̶f̶r̶o̶m̶ ̶J̶B̶L̶,̶ ̶l̶o̶o̶s̶e̶ ̶a̶ ̶s̶t̶a̶r̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶.̶ ̶I̶ ̶d̶o̶ ̶n̶o̶t̶ ̶w̶a̶n̶t̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶i̶n̶v̶o̶k̶e̶ ̶a̶n̶ ̶a̶s̶s̶i̶s̶t̶a̶n̶t̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶r̶a̶i̶s̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶v̶o̶l̶u̶m̶e̶.̶ ̶T̶h̶e̶ ̶S̶o̶n̶y̶ ̶e̶a̶r̶b̶u̶d̶s̶ ̶d̶o̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶v̶o̶l̶u̶m̶e̶;̶ ̶h̶o̶w̶e̶v̶e̶r̶,̶ ̶ (UPDATE: Volume controls can be added through the app as a functionality; however, you loose the ability to change noise modes. I'm still rating 4 stars because I want both, would put 4.5 but can't. I don't see why both sides need a long press for google assistant or siri, one of these long presses could change the noise mode.) I would still pick the JBL buds because the volume steps are more gradual. I can get these to a comfortable level where with the Sony ones it always either a little too loud or a little too quiet. Other than volume I love that the controls are capacitive. Sony opted for actual push buttons in theirs which makes them unusable when laying on your side or for example working on your car, as you constantly bumping/pushing the buttons inadvertently in both cases -- so big win for the JBLs.Overall, a quality earbud for the price but improvements could be made, not sure you can find a more feature rich earbud for this price.","Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2023",AEQIHIUCW2JFJZ43VNHDDSHISNYQ,True,155,Color: Black

I think I’ve had these for almost a year and unfortunately they don’t hold up to use in an environment with lots of dust like a woodshop.

All in all, these issues aside, I’m sure they’re good for somebody. They’re lightweight, sound quality is good, and they’re not too expensive.

As an avid music lover, I've tried my fair share of earbuds, but none have come close to the rich bass and clarity these deliver. The difference from off-brand earbuds is like night and day.One of the things that immediately impressed me is the perfect fit of the gummies. They sit snugly in my ears without ever feeling uncomfortable, and their thoughtful design ensures they stay in place even during rigorous activities.The touch controls are a game-changer. With just a light tap, I can effortlessly control my music and calls without having to press hard or fumble with buttons. Plus, they're so intuitive that I never forget how to use them.While the noise cancellation might not rival that of top-tier brands like Apple's 2nd Gen AirPods Pro, it's still impressive, especially considering the price difference. The talk-through feature is incredibly handy for staying aware of my surroundings while walking in public, and the mic quality during phone calls is superb. It effectively blocks out background noise, ensuring crystal-clear conversations for both parties.Overall, these JBL earbuds have exceeded my expectations in every way possible. From their impeccable sound to their comfortable fit and convenient features, they're a must-have for anyone looking to upgrade their audio experience without breaking the bank.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2024",AGNLDMGAGX2T64CWSRYBFUPCK6OA,True,3,Color: Black
R2WTK9BV6FBQ1,B09JB8KPNW,"4.0 out of 5 stars Weird fit, but lots of features.",Ryan Haley,4,"I got these because of the 40% off sale. Better to get these on sale than other headphones for the same price regularly. The sound is good, but I can't say much for volume because of my hearing impairment and my phone regulates the sound coming out. The fit is really weird, I suggest trying every possible position before saying ""they just fall out"". The instructions give you a few positions to try, but those didn't work for me. I finally found a position where the sound was best and they didn't fall out. However, I do put them pretty deep into my ear and it's a bit uncomfortable so I have to nudge them out just a little. I think the apple airpods are way more comfortable, and other styles like those. These headphones are packed with features like integrated Alexa and an equalizer. The headphones have an app to control all of these features. There aren't any buttons, but it senses your touches very well. Overall I am pleased with them, despite the comfort issue. My ear canals are pretty big, so if you have small ears I do not recommend these. I docked them one star due to the fitting.EDIT: So I figured out how to wear these, and they are very comfortable and they do not fall out. Basically you want to put the thicker part of the earphone pointing straight down, Still might not be good for small ears, but they work perfectly for my bigger ears. My ears are not abnormally large, but I do have larger ear cavities (again, not abnormal). I wish these were a bit louder, they suck for music as compared to my Hesh Evos.

They did suffer moisture damage, so no fault to the headphones for depreciating over time. I didn't have an extra $300 lying around this close to the holidays, so I figured I'd spend the $50 on these. They're honestly not as bad as I expected. They feel VERY cheap - but they aint bad. I struggled with the tips of the earbuds; they kept falling out of my ear. Finally, I switched the tips to the foam tips that came with my sonys and that helped so much! I was shocked at how much more comforatble they became and I no longer had any issues with them falling out. The noise cancelling got a bit better too. Compared to my sonys, the price can't be beat. The sonys completely blocked outside noise. Where these aren't as good - I still have to take out an earbud to talk to someone because I can't hear outside noise very well. I recommend for the price - coming from the leader of the noise cancelling pack of Sony.I only rated 4 stars because in my option, without foam tips, they're kind of trash. I have small ears and I felt like the in-ear piece didn't go in far enough to my ear canal. The moment I switched to the foam tip, they were perfect. That's how much of a difference it made, but I may have been spoiled from my sonys foam tips. If you have issues like this, try the foam tips. They're like $12 for a pack of three on here.

It was so loud we had to get outside before my ears rang off my head. My husband popped in his headphones and turned on the noise cancelling, and he said he couldn’t even hear the fire alarm system.I can hear him clearly while we are on the phone while he’s on a job site. Heavy machinery and people talking to him are cancelled out as a listener. I’m mildly deaf, so it’s hard for me to hear him anyways. JBL nailed it when it comes to clarity.He says his music bumps like you’re in the car with subs. He doesn’t have to turn on his music to such a high volume to have clarity either.There are two different modes so when people approach you, you can hear them talking and respond to them quietly, and noise cancelling. When you switch modes to hear people, it still plays the music and uses the microphone to pull the sound into the earbud like a hearing aid!Battery life is 10/10He said his battery life is always charged. He hasn’t been able to use them from alive to dead because they are always charging in the case or when you put one in and use another and switch. The battery has only been charged once since getting these a few months ago. He said he can get a total charge of 40+ hours and it’s a legit claim on the box.He said they are amazing and nothing short of that.","Reviewed in the United States December 6, 2023",AF3R37KZDCGDMOVOP52UUXTZRCMQ,True,3,Color: Black

R2YLE6449P5CYO,B09JB8KPNW,4.0 out of 5 stars Mixed Bag - Allow me to explain,C. Walbrun,4,"I bought this for rides on my bike since my other pair died after 3hours of use and I ride for a long while.Fit: This will be different for each user. They generally fit comfortably for me. On my bike they don't fall out but they are a little heavier (likely due to the battery).Battery Life: These things go on for a very long time. I get 6-7 hours with them and the case charges them fairly quickly. Generally if I'm on my bike for 7-8 hours I only need a brief 20-30 min in the case when I break for lunch to last me pretty much all day.Noise Cancelling: Pretty abysmal. They definitely do something, but it's pretty minimal. On top of that when wind blows into the mic on my bike the noise cancelling goes nuts and starts giving me weird feedback. Its best to keep it off when I'm on my bike and only on when I'm in the office.Noise Isolating: This may be subjective as well due to fit, but these let in a lot of noise while I'm riding. I hear wind a lot more than other earbuds and it's likely due to the way they are shaped. When I'm just walking around or doing housework, they are about the same as any others.Soundquality: These are ok, not the best. Bass is good, but the volume overall is lower than other earbuds. This may be an isolating issue as well.Overall experience: These are my go to earbuds due to their longetivity despite the down sides. I like them a lot for the price I paid ($65). I wouldn't pay retail for them, but recommend them at a discount.","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2023",AFJFXL43THMCNPWWTGJW2Z3ASPLA,True,7,Color: Black

Dynamic range and volume accuracy is good. Not boom, boom, boom with ear damaging bass thump.3) Has an excellent app providing several equalizer presets. Plus you can manipulate the controls to build your own profile.4) Ability to set the actions of the buds ""switches"" when you tap them via the app.5) Noise canceling (ANS) works. You can block out the world or carry on a normal conversation with music in the background.6) The silicone in ear tips are thicker and better made than others I've had. They attached tightly to the ear bud and it doesn't seem like it will come of in your ear.7) Instruction booklet font size is readible without a magnifying glass. Usually you have to put them under bright light and use a magnifier to read them.8) Price was outstanding at 50% off. I wouldn't pay full price of around $100.00 for them. But, I wouldn't pay that much for any ear buds. I have not heard any that match my old sennheiser earphones and those would be worth it, otherwise no.Cons:1) Honestly none so far of note. Would be nice if you could extra silicone tips in a little pouch or recharging base to save them.I can't speak to play time yet but at least four hours. I've not actually used them longer than that at one sitting.Overall, highly recommend these buds.

RYM2LEY9OAB9L,B09JB8KPNW,4.0 out of 5 stars DOWNLOAD THE APP,David,4,"I actually like these headphones. The lost star is for the fact that they do not really sound that great without the jbl headphone app. Once I popped that on even just using the default eqs, 90% of my complaints evaporated.I've seen people compare these to skullcandy, I'll do the same since my last pair were skullcandy anyway.While the skullcandy delivered solid bass it did so while stomping on mids pretty badly. These do not suffer that issue. While it can be said the bass is louder on the skullcandy set. These are offering a much clearer and well rounded bass without utterly destroying the mid range, and though quiet out of the box the installation of the app brings them to the same volume the skullcandy pushed if not a little louder.Fitting them to your ear can also be a bit of trial and error. I'm actually using a different sized cup on each ear to get the best results for myself.Biggest thing is the app though, it really was a night and day difference. The default club eq seems to work for most genre's or you can of course create your own if you want to get picky.Once the fit and app are out of the way, these are not bad at all. I suppose it bears mentioning that the advertised quick charge feature actually appears to work with these. (this is something that on skullcandy's side seemed like a point blank lie)The touch sensor may be a bit on the sensitive side, but that's been true of the last 4 or so of these I've owned.This review may sound a bit critical but I'm legitimately enjoying them, largely wondering why the default profile for them sounds so bad though. The app immediately clears that up fortunately.","Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2023",AFMSREBL6VFHQ5AXCBBXUZL4HC2A,True,41,Color: Black

R3TWRHHYAV8IDN,B09JB8KPNW,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good customizable wireless earbuds.,Yoshi,4,"By no means am I an expert on earbuds or sound. But I'll give my input anyways. I came across these earbuds while they were 50% off. As a fan of the JBL speakers, I felt obliged to purchase and try these.The design of the earbuds are pretty stylish and look great if style is a factor for you. They are a pretty snug fit in my ears (male medium sized ears) and only really fall off after long usage due to sweat/earwax making the buds slippery. They're fine for light physical activity like walking but they will most likely slip off when doing higher intensity physical activity like running/sports. The earbuds have decent noise cancelling and also allows you to switch to ambient noise mode in which it mimics and filters outside noise through the earbuds for you to hear your surroundings.Sound wise, to be honest they were bad out of the box (in my opinion). When listening to music, the vocals and instrumentals sounded very muffled and mute even at high volume. You will need to download the JBL Headphones app to get access to the EQ as well as additional features like motion controlled shortcuts as well as an earbuds finder tool if you happen to lose a bud. With the EQ you can adjust the ""volume"" of the low, mid, and high sounds. The app comes with presets but allows you to customize your own mix. I found that increasing the slider for the mid range sounds makes the vocals and instrumentals louder/clearer and better.","Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2023",AHBUWEJXAFMQOMFH4R3H4AMFKD4Q,True,14,Color: Black

RJIPYN35HDR1Q,B09JB8KPNW,5.0 out of 5 stars 9 months of daily use review,Yes Man,5,"If you are a basshead, these can be awesome, good enough custom EQ in the JBL app. I've swapped to memory foam tips for the most isolation and grip I can get, and there's no going back. I'm getting a backup pair. I've flown on planes, worked on cars, driven on the highway, and have used these while power washing. In every situation, I'd rather have these in than not, wether for the impressive noise isolation or jamming out, these are a permanent, lifetime companion to me. They connect in a second or two to my 60$ Walmart phone. The case is a good shape, and I regularly get 6+ hours from just the buds. And they can go BIG on the bass. Every once in a while, one bud will get confused and think it's still in the case or out of the case, have to fiddle with it every once in a while but it's not often. The one issue I've had is it completely derping when trying to connect to my laptop. Your milage may vary, maybe my software is out of date? Dunno, just doesn't work with my Acer Nitro 5. I liked these so much, I got a pair for 2 of my close friends and they love them too. It's awesome for phone calls. Just add memory foam tips for better grip and isolation, and phone calls are excellent. They don't exactly snap in place in my ears, hence the memory foam for the extra grip from the texture. But overall, these have brought me peace and music in many, many places. I highly recommend these for people who routinely travel. Or if you're a basshead, these can shine.","Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2023",AEFXDDQA5PNGUNL6TM3FG7565BYQ,True,12,Color: Black

I was surprised at the call quality as well. They could be a bit louder but I love my music load. The only bad thing about these earbuds is that they disconnect from my phone when they’re not being used. Sometimes I put them in my shirt pocket or just leave them in my ears when I’m doing something at work, not on my phone. They just disconnect. You either have to put them back in the case or do a special tap sequence on both buds to connect them again. It’s becomes annoying after awhile. Stay connected until I put you away please.

The earbuds have a noticeable delay in ""music"" (high fidelity) mode, and a still noticeable delay in ""video"" mode, that won't matter most of the time, but is not present in some alternative earbuds.The ANC is nowhere near perfect, but definitely cuts out low droning noises well, and brings the overall exterior volume down, even if it leaves some higher pitched noises in.The pass-through mode works pretty well, unless you're near any loud droning noises like an air-conditioning unit, in which case it boosts that noise a lot compared to other noises.Generally this is a very good product, and if you can find it on sale, I suggest purchasing it.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2023",AGO3V5PLVLXFFSQLQE6UREAIFQWQ,True,2,Color: Black

Also, this may be a matter of taste, but the controls are extremely annoying. Tapping once on the left ear bud changes the ANC setting.

R3HZ6PPJSOHXBY,B09JB8KPNW,5.0 out of 5 stars Enjoy the quiet of JBL noise cancellation,Mithrandir,5,"I bought these JBL headphones because I wanted noise cancellation without having to wear headphones. These are really earphones or ear buds, and I wasn't sure how much noise they could cancel. They cancel almost all background noise and conversation around. I can put them in and listen to an audio book in a room where other people are having lunch and talking. All that noise is gone, cancelled. The full noise cancellation setting is so good that I recommend using it only in a safe setting like sitting down in an easy chair or at a table or desk. Put on a little rainfall and go to sleep. These earphones have two other settings. One lets conversations be heard in the background, so if someone calls you, you can hear them. The third setting is no noise cancellation at all. I am totally satisfied with the noise cancellation feature of these earphones. The sound quality is among the best I have heard in earbuds. The free JBL app lets you choose the kind of equalizer settings you prefer for what you are listening to. The app is a major attraction for setting up the JBL headphones the way you want them to operate. I got exactly what I was looking for in these JBL headphones and so much more besides.

R28D8NZWTRKY1C,B09JB8KPNW,2.0 out of 5 stars Purchased this and another model— disappointing products.,Trevor,2,"I left a very similar review for another one of the JBL headphones. Unfortunately it seems that their whole product line is lacking.BLUF: Spend a couple extra bucks and get Raycon's.I was excited to try these and another model of JBL headphones out, and I got them both on a sale. I'm a fan of JBLs no-frills speakers, and I have the Boombox and one of the Charge series.Coming from Raycons, I was immediately disappointed at the sound quality and noise cancelling features. The sound quality is forgivable— it's a low to mid-range headphone that touts affordability over quality. So be it. The digital noise cancelling, however, was inferior to Raycon's basic headphone that just cancels noise with a good seal. The talk-thru feature can be useful when running with a friend, but the ambient fuzz sound that you have to put up with to use it makes it more enjoyable to just run with one bud out.Comfort is average. After long periods of use, they start to feel uncomfortable, which is to be expected from this range of headphone.The thing that makes this a two-star product for me is the charging case. From day one, the headphones would randomly come off the charger and connect to my phone with me realizing. So the battery would drain on the headphones, and then if I wanted to play something over my speaker or connect another set of Bluetooth headphones, I would have to manually switch devices in the settings.Starting from a couple months ago, the right earbud doesn't seem to sit in the case and won't charge— and therefore won't turn off. My phone is basically perpetually connected to these things now. The only thing that seems to fix that charging problem is for me to take out and reinsert the earbud multiple times to hopefully make the connection.All in all, these would be passable headphones if it weren't for the deteriorating conditions of trying to charge these things. I will not be purchasing JBL headphones again.","Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2023",AFFRD6QV336EYDBZMIFMHHFURIPQ,True,0,Color: Black

BUT, it could just be my ears, but these things are a constant annoyance to get them to stay in your ears. I tried all the different size tips they send, but to no avail, none of them worked. Due to this, I was finding myself constantly adjusting and putting them back in, which to me is just not worth it. I have found that if I wear a beanie, this will help them stay put. While the sound and noise canceling are good for the price, kind of defeats the purpose if they don't stay in your ears.

R1EZFK2V7IDORA,B09JB8KPNW,"2.0 out of 5 stars Buyer beware!!! These Fail at Random, Early, and Often",Bingo,2,"Pros:1)These provide decent quality audio (when/if they function).2)The noise cancellation is there, it kinda works, enough to be a feature anyway. NOTE: the NC is inferior to all other brands I have heard, but it does function kinda so I listed it as a pro.3) Battery life is great (Their best quality)Cons:1) The controls are not intuitive2) They are not reliable at all!!!. First the right ear started playing at an incredibly low volume so that I had to crank up audio to 11 to hear anything. They, without warning, they would suddenly work, and threaten to blow out my ear drums. This started the 3rd week I owned them. Recently, this problem randomly switched to the left ear, and the right seems to function properly3) The fit is really wierd, everyone who tries these out cant seem to get them to stay in their ears (I have had several people try)4) they fall out ALL the time5) they cut out at random6) The build quality feels very VERY low. The case is garbage, the buds feel like they are garbage, and based on performance I have received, I am vindicated in this belief.7) Their app wants permissions that are irrelevant to audio and that amount to stalker level request for info, and you can not control any functions or access the app without giving them permission to access your location, all your data (pictures and videos too), call records, etc. I can't believe they even asked for this info, but you can not even access certain functions of these garbage ear buds unless you grant them access.OVERALL: These are pure, Grade A, 100%, unadulterated Crap. The sound quality is mid level at best. To be fair, battery life is superb, but that is the only redeeming quality. These ear buds are terrible overall, obviously built to extremely low standards, and based on this experience I will NEVER buy another JBL product again after this. I have owned JBL stuff many times in the past with mixed results, but this was the nail in the coffin. The fact that these are sold anywhere but a dollar store is the true mystery.

RJ7FBR7Y2SYWI,B0B2SH4CN6,"5.0 out of 5 stars Best Samsungs Yet, but not Perfect",Mr. Stateham,5,"I upgraded to these after owning the Galaxy Buds Live, which is a very different design. I'm not an audiophile, but I am fairly experienced with mid-tier sound equipment, speakers, and headphones. I built my own 11.1 surround sound movie room using a higher end Yamaha receiver and have used Klipsch, Polk Audio, Paradigm, BIC America, Sony, Yamaha, Pioneer, Bose (don't judge me, they work well in some applications), JL Audio, JBL, Mirage, and other brands of speakers through the years in home and car audio setups. For headphones, I've mainly used wired as early wireless models sounded hollow and tinny in comparison. I've used lower end AKG and Sony buds, as well as mid-tier Sennheisers. I've also used higher end Sony over-ear headphones as well as the highly rated (but lesser known) Status Audio CB-1 studio monitor headphones.I waited a while to buy into the wireless headphone market and finally took the plunge with the Buds Live as they offered something my wired headphones didn't—ambient sound. Usually this is an unwanted distraction and noise isolation is preferred, but sometimes I want to be aware of what's going on around me and be able to engage in a conversation even if I have my buds in. Apple did this well with their pass-through technology, but I'm not about to switch over to an entirely new product line and closed ecosystem just for headphones, so I waited. The Buds Live managed this trick with a low-tech solution by not sealing in the ear canal, so I gave them a try. Sound quality was decent—on par with my lower end AKG wired buds, but not as good as my mid-tier (~$100) Sennheiser buds. They also were finnicky with their connection and cut out a lot if my phone was in my pocket, especially if I bent over or squatted.BUDS 2 PRO:I upgraded to these as they also had a pass-through feature which seemed to work fairly well and did so automatically when you started talking. I figured this would be just as good and offer better sound and isolation when desired. Overall I think this feature works pretty good and is a nice compromise for me. In terms of sound quality, the Buds 2 Pro are definitely a step up from the Buds Live and probably on par with my wired mid-tier Sennheisers. I can't complain about the sound quality at all.As with the Buds Live though, the Buds 2 Pro require a bit of fidgeting to get them seated in the ear properly. Traditional ear buds, and even Apple's Airpods require little thought or adjustment beyond getting the right sized rubber or foam tips for a good seal. Samsung seems to go for more experimental designs which require learning and getting used to. After a few days use, they still aren't ""natural"" to put in or locked into muscle memory—I have to fuss with them a bit to get a good seal. Once in though, I haven't had any problems.Overall, I recommend these buds. They still aren't perfect as the fit isn't intuitive, battery life a little meager, and the noise cancellation is about 85-90%, not 100, but overall, solid headphones. Could you get way better sounding wired headphones for tons less money? Yes, for about $50 you can pick up a pair of Status CB-1's and hear every fine detail in high fidelity. But in the wireless in-ear category, prioritizing convenience and mobility over everything else, these perform admirably. I've heard Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless 3 buds *might* edge these out in terms of sound quality, but they look a lot more bulky (stick out more from the ear and therefore may be less stable) and don't have the automatic ambient sound pass-through feature. They also are a touch more money. On the upside though, they appear to be a more traditional bud design, so might be more straightforward to put in, but Airpods are probably still the easiest to put in and take out.But I plan on using the Buds 2 Pro for years before feeling the need to upgrade again. I'm satisfied with the purchase, though still wincing at the cost-to-performance ratio compared to wired options. Can't knock a product for performing in the top tier of its specific market though, so I'll give it 5 stars as a true wireless earbud, but would give it 4 in sound quality against cheaper wired in-ear and over-ear options.","Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2022",AHWTNTH42P3AHBPICP3ZSJLPVBGA,True,220,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only
R9PNQ2PK9B6MU,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely Positively Amazing!,J,5,"I bought these for my wife. We have bought at least four different sets of earbuds, including off brand and Bose. These Samsung Galaxy Pro 2 Earbuds stand out from the others. I am not sure if it is because of them matching my Samsung Galaxy S20+ or if it is just because they were designed very well and with significant thought. But they are truly amazing.First, setup took less than thirty seconds. Nice simple easy, just the way it should be.The sound quality is equal to Bose. Within the application (Galaxy Wearable), you have an equalizer that offers six different settings. As of this moment I have not found any way to customize the equalizer. These earbuds offer 360 surround sound and head tracking, which allows the sound to focus on the direction of the device that it is coming from. Turning your head to one side makes the earbuds focus the sound a little more to the earbud. I guess that would work great if watching videos or something. For music, I really see no significance.The fit is perfect. They come with three different sizes. My wife needs the smallest and they fit perfectly for her ears. The middle size fits my ears. They are easily changed in a matter of a few seconds. Once on, you do not need to worry about the sleeves coming off easily as with many other brands.The noise cancellation is positively amazing! I have a two-year-old that has the ability to shatter glass with their voice. My ears ring when they scream, and they scream A LOT. That feature alone sold me. As soon as I tried her buds, I went back to Amazon and ordered a pair for me! I can still hear my child, but it no longer murders my ear drums, which is perfect. This nice feature actually enables me to keep my volume down to a safer level. I can't wait to test these buds against my riding mower.Then let's talk about background sound during a conversation on the phone. Every other earbud I and my wife have ever tried has been able to pick up significant background noise. These earbuds seriously focus on the voice of the wearer and not just every sound around them. You can hear their voice clearly and the background noise seems to be ""further away"" making conversation much easier for the other side of the call.These earbuds offer head tilt reminders. I use my computer a lot and when I am working, I do have the tendency to tilt my head forward. These earbuds detect when you keep your head tilted too long and remind you.Notifications are identified by a voice with these earbuds. This is also customizable based according to the application and you can set it to read the notifications in more detail. I know if it is a text message, e-mail or application notification, which is great. Now I don't have to look at my phone every single time to determine if the notification warrants my attention.Operation of the earbuds is pretty simple. While the volume control will certainly take me a little to adapt to, the rest is understandable. First, you can customize the earbuds response to taps and holds (holding finger to a certain earbud) so that you get the features that are most important to you. That alone is nice since no earbud I have experienced has ever allowed this. One downside is the volume control. Where all the other earbuds in the past either had buttons to raise or lower volume or the ability to slide the finger up or down on one earbud, these require both earbuds. The left lowers the volume while the right raises the volume. Answering phone calls (default) is simply double tapping the right earbud. Playing music, tapping the right or left earbud will pause the music and one tap again will resume the music. Double tapping will skip forward one track and triple tap backs it up one track. Of course, as mentioned earlier, you can change this in the application to suit your needs.Battery life is pretty impressive. They boast 29 hours of battery life. So far that seems to be true. My wife uses her earbuds all day and does not need to drop them back into the charger during her daily routine. This certainly stands out against the Bose earbuds I have used that have only about a 3-hour battery life. On top of the extended battery life compared to others, if you are using only one earbud and leaving one in the case, you can change out earbuds mid-call and not lose your call. That is a feature I have never had the privilege of enjoying with other earbud brands.The charging case is simple to use. Just drop the earbuds in. The charging port is a USB-C and they provide a cord in the package. Compatibility to other brand phones seems to be a possible problem, but honestly, I expected that. My wife has an I-phone for work and is not able to connect to it with these earbuds as of yet. The internet does claim they will connect and to my knowledge, they should since Bluetooth is pretty much Bluetooth, and the technology should be the same across all devices.Another nice feature I enjoy is earbud location detection. They will show on a map using GPS, where your earbuds are, which is nice. Also, you can make them ring out to locate them if you are at their location, but just don't see them. These location features do require having the Smart Things application, which is also available in the google play store.Overall, these earbuds are amazing, and they are competitively priced. I highly recommend these for just about anybody.","Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2023",AGODX7KBXEAUHO2KB5T5PFLGM3IQ,True,97,Color: Bora PurpleStyle: Buds2 Pro Only
R2K2P9JHQNF6CL,B0B2SH4CN6,"5.0 out of 5 stars Review after 4 months. Great Earbuds, but not perfect.",Jared Armbruster,5,"First for some background, I have owned at least three different pairs of True Wireless Earbuds with ANC: the Galaxy Buds Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4 Earbuds, and Galaxy Buds Pro 2. I've yet to try any of Jabra's offering and haven't touched Apple Airpods as they have known issues on Android. That said, paired with a newer Samsung phone, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are great. The design and build quality is better than the Galaxy Buds Pro in almost every way. The soft touch finish instead of that annoying glossy design means you're less likely to drop them accidentally while removing them from the case. The case is also conveniently wireless charging or USB Type C Fast Charging. The only thing I don't like about the case is that's it's still a somewhat loose fit for the earbuds, and they need inserted at an angle(by design, but kind of annoying) when putting them back. The fit for me isn't perfect, but I actually find them more comfortable than both the Galaxy Buds Pro and Sony XM4 Earbuds. I hated the glossy finish on the original Galaxy Buds Pro, and the XM4 Earbuds while solid were too large for many users, myself included. These are lighter and more comfortable than either of those two, but it requires messing with it a bit to really get a good seal. If you don't have a Samsung phone, you need to download the Galaxy Wearable App, which allows you to update the firmware(particularly important), adjust EQ, change noise cancelling settings, etc. You can stick with the default EQ, which is overall very balanced, choose another EQ preset, or set your own. They still have Game Mode which I absolutely love, as it keeps input lag to an absolute minimum while playing games like COD Mobile. The ANC is really good, but quite as good as the XM4 Earbuds (TBH it might be a while before anything beats those in ANC). Still very natural sounding Ambient Sound Mode, but then the noise cancelling doesn't nearly block out the entire room like Sony. Sound again is overall very balanced on the default EQ, and I'm quite happy with it. The XM4 Earbuds sounded slightly better, but many users may barely be able to tell the difference if at all, and LDAC never performs as well in terms of latency. I've stuck with the Galaxy Buds Pro 2 due to the better fit over the original Galaxy Buds Pro and Sony XM4 Earbuds, with the fit and seal in particular being my only real gripe. The Game Mode is something more earbuds need to offer at this price point, and it's especially weird for the same company that makes the PlayStation not to have a game mode. On sale the XM4 Earbuds are $10 more than the Galaxy Buds Pro 2, and still lack game mode of any kind. I would still strongly recommend these over the XM4 Earbuds due to the better materials, smaller size, and general comfort. I would especially recommend these if you already have a Samsung phone or tablet, as they pair incredibly well it.","Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2023",AEJMJZ2VIV6MGBXMSKHBEV6D7H4Q,True,124,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

R8JI850UJDRDR,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Worth the money!,Moma Z,5,"I researched on this earbuds for a year when it came out but it was so expensive. Then this year I saw that it's on installment and discounted. It even got more affordable this month, wish I waited longer. I love this because I have the Z Fold 5, been a phablet x stylus user since Note 2! There are so many reasons to invest in this earbuds, most especially if you're a Samsung user.First, it just integrates with my phone intuitively and I can use it with my MacBook 2017 and Garmin Fenix 6s! The Wearable widget helps reconnect the earbuds back to the phone faster than fumbling with the app. I can continue listening to a song or podcast on Spotify from my phone to my laptop and back to my phone, and the sound quality and volume doesn't change.Second, the connectivity is sustained better than other wireless earbuds, whether watching a video, listening, or gaming! There's a gaming option that minimizes the lag between the sound and game action. I can leave my phone farther and still listen to music, or more important, get calls while doing tasks more than 20 feet or more away - even between 2 rooms apart. I had cheaper buds that once I close our steel-cored front door, the connection with my phone will be disrupted even if my phone is just right next to the door.Third, I love the responsiveness to equalizer adjustments! I'm not a sound engineer or audiophile but I used their reviews to narrow down my options based on the products that produce the best sound qualities on the range of frequencies I can already hear with my naked ears. We appreciate sounds differently so it depends on individual hearing but we'd agree that these pricey things respond fast! My hearing was tested, I'm also trained in classical music, and have a healthcare background, so my ears seek refined details from music or physiological sounds. I don't like too much enhanced bass and uncomfortable loudness, as those can lead to deafness. These buds can be loud and bass-proud too! Fresh from the box, these buds were on Normal settings on the Wearable equalizer. To me, I heard the lower frequencies more than the higher ones but I can still distinctly appreciate the higher registers. So I tweaked the equalizer and it responds immediately!!! That equalizer doesn't allow customization but Spotify allows it. I noticed that the Dynamic option looks like the Harman Curve, whether you're a fan of it or not, it's preset already. Although with these earbuds, I can tell if music has been rendered with Dolby, HiFi or some technology... some music do sound unnatural. I had to check the music piece I'm studying if I heard the musical dynamics right, as I might be attempting to produce that sound quality in real life.Now, the stuff I don't like... first, these were so uncomfortable at the start. I can't bear these in my ears for 30 minutes when I first got it. I had to stretch my earlobes and wear these for staggered periods of time per day. I mixed and matched between small and mid-sized tips until the buds fit test say they're ok and it does feel comfortable. It took me a week to adjust my ears and now I can wear them 4 to 6 hours straight. I almost returned these but I thought I'm used to having wired earphones and it's the sacrifice to wireless earbuds that do work. Just like others advice, do the fit test frequently until the fit feels right.Second, the charging case isn't waterproof and shockproof, so I bought the Samsung armor for it. Both the buds and case get dusty pretty quickly. I clean the tips and case with alcohol and tissue.Third, I don't like that it's protruding out of my earlobes but it is what it is. As of this writing, it's one of the smaller and lighter earbuds. I've tried working out and doing sports with these, they pop out when I clench my jaw, move my head in many directions or jump. I have to strap these so if it does pop out, it'll hang from my shoulders and not get stepped on.Oh well, enjoy yours!","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2024",AEEYPCERJ7I4TEGT7BFFPJPOWG7A,True,21,Color: WhiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only
R2MOU34QHN1AIU,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Why did I wait so long to buy these,Thor20,5,"All of my mobile devices are Samsung products. I have the Samsung Note 20 Ultra phone, the Tab 8 Ultra tablet and now I have the latest earbuds Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. Not sure why I waited so long to purchase Samsung earbuds. I would usually purchase either Sony or Jabber and in one case the Amazon Echo Buds (Priced right and used for travel - it lost I didn't pay a lot of $$$ for them). Back to the review. I find the Galaxy Buds to be on par regarding sound, battery life, features, and fit with my Jabber's 75T and close to the 85t.Sound:The earbuds have a rich sound that can be enhanced using the built-in EQ settings. Listen to a lot of Audible Audiobooks and often set the eq to voice. I can clearly hear the voice even when the narrator has a booming bass-filled voice. For music, they do not disappoint either. The sound is rich and clear and has a nice amount of base that does not drown out the vocals.Battery:Battery life is great for my needs. I use these on walks and when my wife drags me along on a shopping trip. With ANC enabled that lasts for about 5 ish hours.Features:-I love how these integrate into the Samsung echo systems. The same Samsung Galaxy wearable app I use for my Samsung Watch 6, is used to manage the earbuds.-Voice Detect is a very cool feature that allows me to automatically turn on ambient sound and lower the volume for a quick conversation. Normal playback resumes after 5, 10, or 15 settings. That way when someone approaches me to have a conversation, I do not have to tap the earbuds or fumble around with my phone to stop playback. This feature also seems to know if I am actually talking to someone versus singing along with the music, super cool tech!-Touch controls are good but limited. For instance, where you can customize what a tap does it does not allow customization for the individual buds. If I set the custom setting of ""Touch and Hold"" to switch noise controls, noise control is then enabled on both the left and right bud. I wish that I could make the left bud handle the noise control and the right handle volume down or something along those lines.-360 Audio:Helps to enhance the overall sound, probably through the EQ settings. The sounds seem to be more dynamic and make me want to dance. There is also a head-tracking function that is used for video/movies. Head tracking adjusts the sound direction when you turn your head, making it seem like the sound is coming from the direction you are looking.Fit:Fit can be subjective as it really depends on your biology. These earbuds have been the best fitting earbuds for me ever. My more expensive Sony WF-1000XM4 had great sound and features but fell short in the fitment department for me, same goes for the Jabra 75T/85T.Summary:My entire immediate family uses the Samsung Echo system. I have purchased these earbuds for everyone but myself. I guess I was being an earbud snob, thinking these were inferior to the likes of Sony and Jabra. These are great earbuds and I recommend you give them a try. I wish I had tried them much sooner. I was going to buy the newer Sony buds WF1000 XM5, but the Samsung bud2 pros were a steal compared to the Sony's so I decided to give them a try. I am so happy I did as these are now my go-to earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2023",AE6F63OVVYNPLQIU2HVJYDXHIVOA,True,31,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only
R2R1WB0JDING7Z,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars I think I'm in Love,AB,5,"I've had these Buds 2 Pro for a few days now and I'm in love with them. I paired them to a Samsung S22 Ultra, so they work together like peas and carrots.HEAD TRACKING: I like the head tracking feature. If you turn your head away from your media the sound increases in the bud that is closest to your device. Keeps the sound focused in the direction of the device. It's rather neat.FIT: I had to change the earpieces out to the smallest right away, but it's important that you get a good fit.They don't bulge from my ears much. Just a bit. There is ""Check fit"" area in the Samsung App.ANC: The noise cancelling is pretty amazing. Actually makes you appreciate the silence when you turn it on. Very close to perfect silence.AMBIENT SOUND: When you switch to ambient sound, the best way to describe it is like a hearing aid. Everything seems a bit loud at first, but you can hear what's going on around you once you get used to it. You don't realize how much white noise is in your environment until you switch off ANC.VOICE DETECTION: I'm not sure if I like the voice detection so much. When you start singing along with the music, your sound decreases until you remember to turn it off. It works well if you're in an office environment and want to lower the audio if you are talking but the shortest return time is 5 seconds if voice is detected. I wish there were a shorter time. Turning on the ambient sound can also be enough. The jury is still out on that feature.TOUCH CONTROLS: The touch controls are responsive, but I wish I could change the taps to customize it more. I might want to switch between noise cancelling and ambient sound or change the volume, but I can only do one or the other with the current setup. It wasn't a deal breaker for me.COMFORT: They're comfortable enough for me to have in my ears for an extended period of time with the correct sized earpiece. They're easy to insert, but button presses are inevitable when inserting them. They sync right up to my Samsung phone and watch.FASHION: My ears are quite small, so the tiny ends were my choice. They don't bulge out of my ear too much. Just a little, really. Sometimes I can hear my hair brush the buds and a wet head has tripped a button press, but it hasn't been a deal breaking issue. Just something to be aware of.I haven't tried using these in bed, which will probably happen at some point as I like to catch up on shows when I can't sleep, so I can't speak for comfort if you lay on one ear while using them.OVERALL : Fit is good. Sound is nice. They're very responsive and easy to use. I'd recommend them to any Samsung user for compatibility and interoperability. I think I'd get these even if I used something other than Samsung, though. They're well made and the texture is rubber-like so they're easy to handle. Case can charge wirelessly, which is a convenient plus.","Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2023",AEDZG63RE35BTYYIVOFECPY4TF5Q,True,143,Color: Bora PurpleStyle: Buds2 Pro Only
R3A8VH1LKW7IO8,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars a must have for dirt biking,B,5,"I recently had the opportunity to experience the SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, and I must say, these true wireless Bluetooth earbuds have left me thoroughly impressed, surpassing even the renowned Apple Powerbeats Pro in several aspects.First and foremost, the noise-canceling capabilities of the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are a game-changer. The ability to block out external distractions and immerse oneself in music or calls is unparalleled. It's a stark contrast to the Powerbeats Pro, which, while excellent, do not offer active noise cancellation. This feature alone elevates the listening experience to a new level.Sound quality is another area where the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro shine. The sound is crisp, clear, and well-balanced, delivering rich bass and detailed highs. The adaptive sound feature adjusts the audio based on your surroundings, ensuring optimal audio quality whether you're in a quiet room or a bustling street. While the Powerbeats Pro offers impressive sound quality, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro's noise-canceling prowess gives them a slight edge.Comfort and fit are crucial for extended use, and here, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro excel. They come with multiple ear tip sizes, ensuring a secure fit for various ear shapes. The lightweight design and ergonomic shape make them comfortable to wear for hours, even during intense workouts. While the Powerbeats Pro are comfortable, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro's superior noise-canceling and comfort combination tips the scales.Battery life is impressive, providing ample playback time and talk time on a single charge. The fast charging feature is convenient for those quick top-ups on the go.The Samsung Galaxy Wear app enhances the overall experience, allowing for easy customization of touch controls and access to various sound profiles.In conclusion, the SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are a testament to Samsung's commitment to innovation and quality in the audio realm. While the Apple Powerbeats Pro are undoubtedly excellent earbuds, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro's noise-canceling capabilities, sound quality, and overall comfort make them a superior choice for those seeking a premium wireless audio experience. Samsung has truly raised the bar with these earbuds, and they come highly recommended.","Reviewed in the United States September 17, 2023",AHO6CJWXBPILQJZJ3EYZUZ2B5G6Q,True,22,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

The case feels a little cheap and doesn't feel very durable, but as long as you're careful you're fine. The fit of them, however, is a big problem for people like me who have very greasy ears. The silicon ear tips easily slide out and don't seal completely. I fixed this by ordering memory foam tips, and I've never looked back.The noise canceling is... OK. It's really not amazing unless I turn whatever I'm listening to up very loud. This is painfully apparent on something like a plane.

I loved them but just figured I would upgrade.The look of the Buds2 Pro is very sleek and better than the live. They're not glossy like the live and the overall design just looks better. However, I had a hard time getting these to fit snug in my ears. When I would finally get them to fit nicely, any movement of my head would loosen them. When I would try to adjust them, obviously I would end up pausing or playing my audio when I didn't want to because I had to touch the ear buds. I just figured maybe my ears needed to get used to them like the buds live. About a month later I'm still struggling with getting them to fit.One feature that I love about the galaxy buds is that I don't have to pause my audio to take them out. I can just take them out of my ears and it will automatically pause. However, with these, I would notice that my audio was still playing when I took them out. I listen to podcasts during the day while I work. I usually only wear one at a time so I can still hear my phone ringing or hear people talking to me. Occasionally I would need to take my ear bud out to answer the phone or talk to someone so I would just set it on my desk in front of me until I could pick it back up. It's easier than trying to put it back in the case for just a minute or 2. Well a lot of the time, I would notice that my ear bud was still playing while it was sitting on my desk in front of me. So, I would have to pause my podcast, take the ear bud out, then make sure my podcast stayed paused. My touch when taking it out would cause it to start playing again. But I couldn't figure out a way to take it out without touching it in a way that would play it.These ear buds are nice and I'm sure they work for people that plan on wearing them for long stretches without taking them in and out. I'm going back to my galaxy buds live and maybe I'll try a different pair another time.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2024",AF67OV74JJEQLEO5D2NPMHB3ALNA,True,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only
R2LMILI3XYE6DJ,B0B2SH4CN6,4.0 out of 5 stars About perfect for wireless headphones.,Crank,4,"For what they are, I think the device is well-engineered. The Pro 2s are high-quality earbuds. You really kind of need the Samsung app for the equalizer and the various settings you get with touch and sound, so make sure to get it. Without the app, I wouldn't really think they are the best choice. But most people will be using these with Galaxy phones. Equalizers per music player, such as VLC, are much better so be sure to use that if you have it to get the best sound.These buds are lighter compared to the previous Pro model. A huge plus. They fit perfectly in my ear almost, and they don't really seem like they will fall out even when running or working harder than normal. I will have to test them for longer lengths of time. So far so good.The packaging and contents are very simple: you get three sets of tips, though, the middle ones are default and worked great, with one smaller cord to charge the magnetic box for storage. It's a grippier, matte texture for the box too. Mine came in a simple plastic bag from Amazon.It is highly recommended you download the Wear app from Samsung. Once you have that they are very easy to set up, and you can constantly monitor whatever you need to with ease. Warranty and registration were a bit harder than I would have liked, but it's doable, not that the warranty is very long on these. You only get a year, and everybody should realize these cannot take many falls. They are very sensitive, so make sure they fit your ears!The features on these are pretty killer all told. I usually turn noise-cancellation off, as it uses too much battery, and I don't really want or need that kind of thing. Ambient sensors when talking are awesome, and the normal isolation is a good space between something like Etymotic in-ear headphones and Sennheiser open-backs. You can fiddle with settings to get your preferences for how you touch and manipulate the device. I found my preferences were quite easy to set up, and the whole thing took about ten minutes.I had no issues with sensitivity on the touch panel area of the earbuds. Works great for me. I do wish these came with a better equalizer, but the Clear setting is probably the most balanced. These are way too bassy out of the gate, and the response is definitely not flat. The Clear setting reduces the bass a bit for a more neutral and even setting with a touch of added treble. I just wish they would let us direct our own EQ options though. Seems like it would be a pretty easy addition to the software. Volume wasn't overpowering at max, but I think it did the job. Again, this is nothing like an amped pair of open-back headphones, so don't expect concert-level sound.AKG has engineered these fairly well in the product space. I'd put them up there with some decent midrange in-ear headphones like the Etymotic ER3XR. There is no way these will compete with any decent open-backs like a Sennheiser HD600 when amped, but I didn't expect that. For what they are, they do the job well, look and feel nice, and the new matte texture is vastly superior and more premium than the first Pro by a mile.All told, if you want to go the wireless earbud route, these are a top option with very few competitors when you take in the whole experience. They won't replace my normal wired headphones at all, but they might be a godsend at work when I just need to chill out and listen to some tunes without the bother of lugging my phone around and wires getting in the way.I don't recommend using these things for hours at a time. There is a serious lack of scientific knowledge on the amount of low-dose radiation over long periods of time. RF, EMR, et cetera. A lot of newer, independent science is starting to find anomalies with oxidation with lower doses and non-ionizing radiation in general. SAR data so far still uses fairly old standards, and though these are a little less powerful in specific absorption rate than a high-end phone, most wear them for WAY longer than that while directly in your ear.If you do need some quality in-ear wireless buds, these are definitely an option to consider. Their SAR data was slightly below the Airpod levels at least. All in all you can't do much better for your wireless audio needs.","Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2022",AH3ICCTF4GUQ75BASLIXFJLPXLQA,True,138,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

These earbuds don't hold a charge near as good. I also have a Samsung watch and phone, and their battery life kinda sucks too, maybe it's just Samsung products. Not really a complaint, just something to keep in the back of your mind.As for what they do, 5 stars for options, 4 stars for sound.They're really handy on an airplane or some form of public transportation. No bulk like my Skull Candy headphones. Sound is pretty good, and the option settings are cool.Would I buy them again? Yeah, most likely I would.

R2V1YJUQOEQU7R,B0B2SH4CN6,1.0 out of 5 stars Total garbage!,The Critic,1,"These are quite possibly the most expensive, worst earbuds I've ever purchased in my life.I own the original Galaxy buds, which are fantastic. They stay in my ears, they seal well and have great sound because of the fit and drivers. The originals pair easily with my Motorola phone and the app works fine. Regular updates kept them working and up-to-date. I even accidentally left the case with the earbuds inside of them outside on a summer night when it rained, the next day I thought I was sunk. I took them in, dried them off and they've been working fine 2 years later... The original Galaxy buds are that good.For me the originals were missing one or two things that I thought would make it worth the upgrade. Active noise cancellation was huge for me and the originals do not have this. I like to use my earbuds outside in the summer doing yard work like cutting the lawn weed whipping and things like that... I sweat profusely and need something that's resistant to water and sweat. They also have to stay in my ears as I'm actively moving around on a lawn, where if one were to fall out good luck to me finding it... I was also interested in the sound pass thru feature that lets you hear ambient sound, if you wish while wearing the buds, the originals have this but it is not in stereo, so it does not help you if you were walking on the street or riding a bike. You would hear a car coming but could not distinguish the direction. These 2 Pros have stereo pass thru.Anyway, on Amazon Prime, garage sale day I decided to go ahead and pick these up for almost $200 (I know what was I thinking?)... I was excited for the upgrades. The headphones came and I immediately noticed something that I had not researched before, these headphones are not actually made by Samsung engineering, they are made by AKG. AKG happenes to make headphones for studio applications and they usually have a very flat, tinny or shrill response that I've never liked. This was a bad sign...I paired the earbuds to the phone using the same app as the originals and all went well. After an update I was ready to give them a shot. The earbuds would not stay in my ears. Try as I might they slipped and slid and they kept falling out of my ears. This is frustrating because it's purely down to the design of the shallow ear canal, speaker. I have no idea why they would have gone with a different shape as the earbuds now only barely sit in the ear canal. The speakers do not seal no matter which ear tips I tried as the earbuds came with three different silicone sizes. The design of these headphones is baffling. A quick Google search will point out that this is a very common problem that I was not aware of before I purchased them, and people will recommending purchasing aftermarket tips to solve this problem. After spending this much on a pair of earbuds, no way am I going to start looking for fixed to their major design flaws, spending more money and time in the process. The Samsung Wear app even has a setting that helps you test, to see you when you have a good seal on the earbuds which I could not attain unless I violently jammed them in my ears, to which they only stayed sealed for maybe 30 seconds before they started coming out and just plopped out of my ears every single time. Wrestling the earbuds into your ears is an exercise and frustration as every time you touch the stupid things you activate some setting or pause a song or switch to the next song or mute them or try to make a call... It's infuriating!After 20 minutes of a balancing act and attempting to get the earphones to stay in my ears, with a good seal, I finally was able to get them to stay for just a few seconds while I not moving at all. This was not going to work outside, but I wanted to test some of the other features. This led me to testing the active noise canceling which although the app told me I had a good seal did absolutely nothing but to block out only the slightest breeze of the AC in the house. It failed to even block out the fault hum of the washing machine, running in my laundry room. What?! When using something like a lawn mower or a leaf blower these will do 100% absolutely nothing. I am positive the attempt to block out the sound of airplane engines would also be futile with this extremely wimpy ""noise canceling""... This is a major disappointment and as far as I'm concerned false advertising.I decided to give the sound a shot just to hear how they reproduce music that I've listened to for years with no issues on my original Galaxy buds which I think sound great. Just as I feared, typical AKG, no matter which setting I chose the highs are so hyped they tickled my eardrums in the most unpleasant of ways, irritating me to the point where I had to literally turn the music down to the lowest volume to be able to bear the shrill, high-pitched highs. I tried every EQ setting they offer and not one of them took away this ridiculous high-pass. Complete and utter, $200 fail!I honestly can't express how disappointed I am in these things and would urge anyone to simply stay away. These are a huge disappointment and have soured me from Samsung audio products. How could they get it so right the first time around and totally doo-doo the bed, with these?!TLDRTerrible sound quality, horrible fit, ridiculously ineffective active noise canceling, huge unwarranted price tag.Total garbage.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2023",AGHMOR4A4MZUIVGIMRCFLGWUSTXQ,True,88,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

R30QH4E5NOMRKO,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars In love with my new Buds,S. Strand,5,"These are my first pair of 'unwired' buds. Was using a Bose model previously. I have a Samsung Galaxy S10+, so setting these up was a snap. I literally opened the case and they connected to my phone. I love all of the options for controlling the buds, noise control, voice detect, 360 audio, etc. - they all work spectacularly. The case is the charger which is kinda cool, you can charge the case without the buds and charge the buds without the case being plugged in. They come with different sized covers so you can use the ones that fit your ears the best, and the fit test in the app is a great feature. I do wish they had wings though, I've always had a hard time getting buds to stay in my ears. Overall, I do love them (especially the color ;) ).Couple of minor things to note - obviously none of these were deal breakers for me: 1. The touch sensors are exactly that - touchy. When adjusting them in my ears it's very easy to accidentally change a setting. On the bright side, it's pretty easy to change it back. 2. You can't connect to 2 devices at once, i.e.; phone and laptop. My old buds did and would switch to the active device, so kind of missing that. Connecting them to devices other than the phone is pretty simple, however, and once set up it's just hitting 'Connect' and you're good to go. 3. The charging cable is USB-C to USB-C. I don't have a USB-C compatible charging block and don't want to keep them plugged into my laptop, so I found a USB to USB-C cable and use that. No issues. 4. They are a little uncomfy when trying to get them to sit in my ears correctly. But once seated they do stay pretty snug and I hardly notice them. I use them when running/working out and they haven't fallen out yet. Although I did almost lose one down the garbage disposal today, so take that with a grain of salt 5. SmartThings App. I installed this based on some troubleshooting I was doing with a knockoff pair I bought (didn't realize they were knockoffs at the time). When installed it automatically connected my earbuds to my phone and if I was running my mobile hotspot, it would automatically disconnect the hotspot. A serious pain in the ass since I use that for meetings… it was driving me batty so I uninstalled it. It's not a necessary app for legit buds. 6. I connected these to my laptop and had issues with sound cutting in and out. Found out it is usually related to an out of date Bluetooth driver. So if you are connecting to your laptop and the sound cuts in and out, update your Intel Bluetooth driver - should fix the issue.","Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2023",AG4IQ3C7VKE3USVUNWLWNWGJTJEQ,True,29,Color: Bora PurpleStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

That said the ear tips come in 3 sizes but seem to be outside the normal sizes I'm used to with every other earbud I've ever bought which is many. In Samsung I'm somewhere between large and medium. I use the large as they keep the buds in my ears. The medium come out after a while. The other issue I have is these love to dissconnect when I move away from the case. I suffered this issue with my cheap pair which is why I moved to a higher end bud with the stated promise these wouldn't do that.

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE APP.I was happy to learn you can connect these buds like any Bluetooth speaker or headphones. If you read the slim instructions with the buds, they direct you to download the app. I did. I uninstalled the app in about 5 minutes.The app requires that you be permitted to access your entire phone - all of it. Call logs, contacts, SMS, and more. IMHO, the app is a dark dank hole that wants access to everything. I did find one feature that requires the app to turn it on. I'll live without that feature.Now, they work great! Seriously nice. They fit well, they have a great sound. They came with a little box of replacement earbud tips (it might have been nice if they were labeled).Another SERIOUSLY GREAT feature is that if you have a compatible phone, you can charge your earbuds on the back of your phone wirelessly.I had to look up the various taps and what they did online. I assume the app would have explained those functions.If Samsung reads this, change the app! I don't want to make a phone call or send a text message with earbuds. I bought them to just listen to music. The app should not require all that permission.

R2M9A8TF54GXNP,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Blown away by the sound quality !!,AmazReviewer111,5,"Just got these today, along with the Sony Linkbuds S. My very first bluetooth earbuds. I've mostly used Bose Quiet comfort headphones for the past decade, which I've been thrilled with, they've revolutionized my life. But as I frequently need to take reading glasses on and off, headphones can be inconvenient, and so I wanted an earbuds option.I haven't tested all the features yet, but I'm absolutely gobsmacked by the sound quality of these -- so rich and full. More than enough bass-- in fact I needed to cut it back a bit in the EQ settings (I use the 'clear' mode). Very close to headphone quality, how do they do it??So comfortable to wear too, I can imagine having them in all day. My only complaint is that the ""Wearable app"" you need to get all the features demands a LOT of permissions on your android device, way more than seems necessary and that bothers me. I'll put up with it for now.I initially had some trouble pairing it to multiple devices, but after some fiddling I can switch pretty seamlessly between my galaxy phone, tablet, and Dell computer. Not sure I could write a 'how to' on it, as I seem to have stumbled on 'success' by accident, and the 'youtube' videos on this subject were NOT helpful.Comparing to the Linkbuds S: the sound quality on these is substantially better than the Linkbuds. The linkbuds go more deeply into the ear and feel more 'snug', so I might use those outdoors vs these indoors. I like the fact that via the wearable app, I can set these earbuds to control volume via 'tap and hold'. The Linkbuds don't seem to have this feature, you need to adjust the physical controls on your device to control volume. That's a little ding for the Linkbuds and a huge plus for these, as I like convenient volume adjustment of music above all else.I don't make/receive many phone calls, I mostly listen to music. So can't comment on those features. But if you mostly listen to music as I do, it's hard for me to imagine complaints. Noise cancellation is not as good compared to Bose quiet comfort -- but these are earbuds afterall, and so my expectations for noise cancellation are low, and as I mostly stay home have not had a chance to really test it. But it does do SOMETHING. I think if I were in a high noise environment I'd be inclined to use the headphones.But based on sound quality and comfort alone, I highly recommend! If I were to keep only ONE of the earbud options I'd go with this one.","Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2023",AFSPZMQGFOXAOEOIPWNM7XVSDDBA,True,18,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

Noise cancellation was on par with the AirPods and they fit nicely in the ear.What I didn’t like - and why I returned them - is the way they interact with the Galaxy phone. I am accustomed to keeping my iPhone in my pocket and speaking commands like playing music and texting or placing calls via my AirPods. I was very disappointed to find out I would have to take my Galaxy phone out of my pocket and unlock it to get spoken commands to get carried out.

R23EVEQK7Z967S,B0B2SH4CN6,"4.0 out of 5 stars Works good on calls, at least for me",Wade Burchette,4,"I bought these only because I needed something that let me talk while working, but still keep my hands free. I have a need to work on equipment while talking to various companies tech support lines. While a speakerphone does allow me to hear them, it does not help them to hear me. I did not buy this for music, because my cheap wired headphones with a USB-C connector deliver better music quality due to those pesky laws of physics. (It should be illegal for phones to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack.) Despite how they look, for me they work just fine for calls. However, I can see their design would also cause them not to work for some people. Be prepared to return them if that is the case.Setting up the earpiece was relatively straightforward. Since I already have a Samsung phone, I decided on these. The Galaxy wearable app opened, and the process started. It included 3 difference sized earpieces, and the app said each one was not a good fit. So I stuck with the medium sized piece.By default noise cancellation was on. But this quickly gave me a terrible headache. 5 minutes with these in and noise cancellation going was enough to give me a headache for the rest of the day. I turned off noise cancellation the next day and I didn't get a headache. I think I got motion sickness due to the noise cancellation.I haven't tested the battery life. These headphones are for work, not music. I only did a limited test in music quality, again because my only concern is telephone conversations. For that, they work fine for me.Update: I finally tested the music for this. The quality was good enough, but clearly inferior to a cheap set of wired headphones. Also, the delay in bluetooth is evident in videos if you look close enough. The lack of physical buttons is a serious issue. While working outside, a gnat got in my ear and to get it out, I had to touch an earpiece which paused the music. I found myself frequently accidentally touching them; very aggravating. Although it was nice to be able to work outside a few feet away from my phone. Kept my phone from getting damaged. None of the advantages outweigh the advantages of a proper headphone jack, but it is a nice ALTERNATIVE in certain situations.Also, irreplaceable batteries should be very very illegal, even for tiny headphones like this.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2023",AFB66A2UCVKAUAASM32TUIF2C3JQ,True,16,Color: WhiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

If you are looking for sound quality out of a wireless set of earbuds, you can almost just stop here and be fine.My smaller issue is the fit. They fit pretty well, but aren't staying in for longer periods of time. I feel like I'm always re-adjusting them. I will have to see if comply foam tips will fit as those will probably help resolve that issue.My bigger issue is actually the software. God forbit any one company get things right. I've had Sennheiser Momentums that sounded really good, but over time died so I moved on to the venerable Sony XM3's. They were really nice, but you couldn't adjust the volume like you could with the Sennheisers. Ok fine, their software allowed for a lot of customization though. I won't ever go back to Sony's though as the battery life on those is absolutely terrible. Not when they're new. But after only about a year the XM3's wouldn't hold a charge. I thought moving to the XM4's would help, but alas, after a year they wouldn't hold a charge either. Not sure what Sony is doing battery wise, but they need to do something else.So I moved on from the Sony's to these. Right away, I liked the sound of these so much more. But the software, while nice, is not very friendly when it comes to customizing them. You can't set anything to be whatever you want. You can't set the left and right to do individual things. My left is set to where if I hold it the earbuds go from ANC to Ambient sound and vice versa. The right side is set to go between Normal and ANC. But you can't set one side to go through the three settings (like you can on Sony). Why? This seems nonsensical. Also, with the Sony's I could have them connected to two devices at once and it would just play whichever device was being used. Not these.While I highly recommend them for sound quality, the software, while looking good, is actually weird and a little clunky. To me, it's not quite PRO level. Maybe some future updates will get it there though.","Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2023",AFGN67F34G52AW46JQAUKPPBNDRQ,True,17,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

R1TMMXO3INSIOG,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars A journey from Galaxy Buds+ to Galaxy Buds 2 to Galaxy Buds 2 Pro,Jenna Rhine,5,"So here is an initial Day 1 review.I started with the Galaxy Buds+ and was ""generally"" happy. The sound quality was excellent, the volume decent, the phone calls were acceptable and the fit was comfortable and stayed in place (for about 30 minutes) My biggest problem was the ""wings."" They helped the buds stay in place but due to the design, they tended to rotate since they were only being aligned by a tiny plastic nub. And once the wings rotated the fit was horrible.So I eventually upgraded to the Galaxy Buds 2. These also sounded very good, better in fact than the Galaxy Buds+. The calls and audio volume were similar, so perfectly functional. But now I had noise cancelling and a brand new form factor! The noise cancelling worked great for my needs. I'm not flying all over the country, but they nicely limited the white noise of public spaces. Unfortunately the fit was even worse. The Galaxy Buds 2 were slightly oblong in comparison to the Buds+, which I believed would be the answer to the ""wandering wings"" and finally give me the stable fit I'd been looking for. Alas, this was not the case. The only way the buds would stay in my ear is from a friction fit of the cushions in my ear canal. Not comfortable! And if I spoke or chewed food, it was only a matter of seconds before they had worked themselves loose. In every way except fit, the Galaxy Buds 2 were a definite upgrade.Now we arrive at the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. I have had them for about 5 hours and here are my initial impressions:- Getting them in the right orientation took me some time (probably because I'd been historically wearing ear buds goofy just to try to get them to stay in my ear.)- Once I had the ear buds in correctly, the fit was surprisingly comfortable and ""light"" feeling. At first I questioned whether they were positioned properly (the ambient noise being on also added to the idea.) When I turned off the ambient noise I realized how well the buds were fitting.- Chewing and speaking did not disrupt the fit at all!- The ANC worked as expected.- The sound was EXCELLENT in comparison to the previous Buds+ and Buds 2. I found the Buds 2 Pro to be louder, crisper and punchier than the previous earbuds.That's it for now. I'm cautiously optimistic about my purchase and I will follow up in a few weeks with more review. Moving forward I'll be focusing on how easy/hard it will be to quickly position the buds in and how much I end up ""messing with them"" while wearing them.","Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2023",AH4CNC6Z3U3ET6E4POKZ2TH2XQMQ,True,93,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

R16RHL4WQWQYYT,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Great earbuds with some caveats,AzaleasRoad,5,"These are great earbuds with great quality sound (for earbuds) and excellent software integration. They are my first Samsung earbuds (using an S22 Samsung phone), and I am particularly impressed by the comfort, good sound and intuitive user controls.These are the first earbuds I've put in that were immediately comfortable to wear with no adjustments, and they felt like light clouds, no discomfort at all and they fit in just snug enough, but not too tight.Samsung just about nailed touch controls as well, with 1 tap to play/pause, 2 quick taps to go to next track, triple tap for next track, and customizable (touch and hold). I have my right earbud setup to change from ambient sound to noise cancelling mode (which works quite well and blocks out significant noise), and the left buds set to bixby voice assistant, press and hold are customizable for each year. I've used earbuds before that had physical buttons, and while the controls gave good feedback, they uncomfortably changed the entire position of the earbud or pushed them too deep in my ear, I enjoy putting them in once and not messing with the position. I've also enabled ""experimental tap"" where I find I can double tap the outside of my left ear to lower volume, or right ear to increase volume and it works great. Have not tried phone calls yet.Sound quality is particularly nice on these, with deep, rich bass coming from such tiny things. Mids and highs sound good with excellent detail and good enough soundstage. My large over-the-ear headphones of sound better, but I'm not sure earbuds could sound dramatically better than these considering their size. EQ settings are also customizable and make a noticeable difference depending on what you're listening to.The most mediocre thing about these earbuds are the battery life, but it's an acceptable sacrifice since it looks like they shrunk the size down to make them more comfortable. Case and buds have a nice, decently grippy matte finish, and they last ~5-6 hours depending on whether or not noise cancellation is on. Another nice touch I've found is Samsung provided ""Buds"" software in the microsoft store, so I use them on my PC with full touch control, EQ settings etc. This seems unusual among other earbud brands I've tried.Overall I'd give them a 9/10, if they had a bit better battery life they'd score higher, but as long as the case is nearby with quick-charging for an all-day marathon, they are good enough for my needs.","Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2023",AFFZTVNUGG5NUQD3RLCHYVDNLXHQ,True,24,Color: WhiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

You can even turn off most of the advanced features if you want to keep it extra simple.","Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2024",AFMLCXUWKUK5AQEKUZEN5N7O4JSQ,True,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only
R1A38281ZRWIP9,B0B2SH4CN6,1.0 out of 5 stars A total and complete embarrassment compared to the Galaxy Buds Pro (1),Nicholas Szkolnik,1,"As someone that is reasonably dissatisfied with the battery life of the Galaxy buds anyway, I bought the Galaxy buds pro 2 because they were the only ones available since they released in newer model.I did so so that I had earbuds to use throughout my work day.So everyday I use my Galaxy buds pro, and then when they die I use my Galaxy buds pro 2.I will randomly list all of the biggest differences I have noticed.Starting off, audio-wise they don't sound any different.Build quality, at this point subpar.My first Galaxy buds have had zero issues throughout the life of me having them. Which I would argue is a pretty long time, I got them on a Black Friday sale probably 3 years ago maybe.My first pair of Galaxy buds pro 2 had to be returned within the first month of having them because somehow someway They started making a screeching sound in the right earbud. After sending them out to be fixed They deemed them to be irreparable and sent me a new pair. Additionally the most amazing feature that I love about these Galaxy buds pro earbuds is the little tiny filter that is in the silicone earbud itself. It makes preventing ear wax from getting inside the actual headphone not something to worry. Unfortunately, with the Galaxy buds pro 2, which I've had for a significantly less amount of time than the 1's, The filter has already came out of place and is unable to properly go back in place.Now This next problem I have with them might just be me and how I use them, but the sensitivity for noise reduction when using active listening is significantly more sensitive with the buds pro 2. For me that's a problem, because I typically use them while I'm at work to reduce the general noise around me since I work in a loud environment. I typically go most days wearing them all day in active listening, and sometimes simple beats from the machines or the backing up of a forklift will trigger that noise reduction. I feel that that is a little too sensitive because in certain areas of what I'm doing it's always going off where it'll cut the noise from listening to your environment to almost noise cancellation.After using both of them for a long period of time now, Even though the Bud's pro 1 is older, I would definitely argue that they last longer than the buds pro too.Overall I'm very disappointed in the buds pro 2 in the battery life, durability, and overall longevity of these earbuds. At the very least compared to their previous model, this is a downgrade.","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AFH4QG3AF2EGSND47Z3B6PQDBT6A,True,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

Noise cancelling tech works good. Still trying to get use to the touch commands and trying to remember how many taps does what. I also use the larger size, but the plugs still fall out of my ears with even minor movement. This causes a problem because when I have to touch the earbuds to push them back into my ears, the touch commands get activated. Also, while using the plugs during a phone call, I have been told that I could not be heard very well though the mic on the earbuds. I'm hoping they will work better the more I get use to using them.","Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2024",AES3ZCSINHX2G7EFUX7YAHKXRPWA,True,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

I use these with an S20 and a Windows PC, both of which are great for meetings and calls. I had to stop using the Bose for any voice calls because their sound quality sounds like you're calling from Mars.Drawbacks when compared to the Bose: Not quite as much noise cancellation, and not as ""big"" of a sound.

R3NV655BFF43YD,B0B2SH4CN6,4.0 out of 5 stars Fun earbuds,Gormph,4,"I bought these to replace my Moondrop Sparks which died on me because I kept using them at work despite not having any IPX rating. This led me to looking for a earbud with an IPX rating but that still had good sound, and while my Moondrop Sparks certainly win out in the sound department, IMO, the Samsung buds win in almost every other way.Pros:1. Battery life of the earbuds is good, with ANC off I can make it though a day at work no problem, and I normally use only one earbud at a time at work anyway.2. Sound is good, while you can get better sound for a lower price, you lose many features such as the high IPX7 rating, ANC, Passthrough, etc.3. When I do use both earbuds at work this is where the ANC shines, while the ANC cant seem to handle high frequency sounds, the droning of factory machines is totally blocked out.4. IPX7Cons:1. Case battery life is weak IMO, while I understand this is to keep case size small and was a design choice for me it is still a con.2. Costly, I got these as a refurb because the full price is far to much. As all TWS earbuds will one day die and have to be replaced these are simply not worth the full price to me, I am pleased that the price seems to drop over time but as It stands now I could have bought two pairs of my Sparks at the full price of these buds, at that point given how long they lasted I cant say these are worth the price for me.3. Ambient mode can not handle wind at all, in any form not even a light breeze.4. Doesn't get loud enough with a single earbud to use in noisy environment.Overall a good pair of earbuds, I like them and they work for what I got them for perfectly well.","Reviewed in the United States June 26, 2023",AHU4DRYSASSQLSLYDTTF7KSCEYFQ,True,19,Color: GraphiteStyle: Buds2 Pro Only

R139H1OPHAZEKM,B0B2SH4CN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Well designed,Daniel,5,"Ive had both XM4s (headphones and earbuds) and the galaxy buds pro.These beat XM4 earbuds in term of noise cancelling because those rely on a seal and these don't. 200% better noise cancelling than previous buds pros. Noise cancelling is impressive for their size. obviously xm4 headphones had undefeatable noise cancelling (minus xm5). Im not gonna argue the xm4 earbuds thing, all ima say is every person i know hates the tight torturous fit on the xm4 earbuds that the noisecancelling experience has the toll of pain for prolongedThe reason why i did not return these as they perfromed was their comfort and usability. I'm an audiphile, and the sound quality with Tidal is an 8.5/10 compared to 9.9/10 xm4s and 7/10 for previous pros. Went to the gym with these and they are practically not there. I game with these on transparent mode and its like my friend is in the room). These are just so practical, its a good reason to buy them to be ready for anything. I can shower and walk in the rain with these, where i cant with my xm4s. The xm4 earbuds were so garbage (bulky, heavy, terrble design, terrible ear tips) i had to return them.Sound quality is good. Not excellent. althought they are 24 bit, their range is not as high as LDAC. I think they have the same components as previous pros, smaller woofers and stuff, sound a bit better, better chip. Sound quality is definitely good enough for me as an adiophile although its a downgrade from xm4s.These are way better than the XM4 earbuds, period. Idk what it is with all the hype with the xm4 earbuds but those are so uncomfortable and the eartips break sooo easily. These headphones are deffenitly worth 180 for daily use. Super happy with purchase. ive been using for about a week in athlete and studious setting and no relative complaints. I have these on 50% of the day and they sit comfortably. I was so used to the previous generations attrocious fit, i was shoving these in deep at first. I got used to the fact u can just place these in like airpods, and they hook very well. There are no volume issues as i have read, people just dont clean their ears and wax jams in the canal.

R1780M77DQ2YCB,B0B4PSQHD5,5.0 out of 5 stars A life changing purchase and fixed connection issue,Lillyander,5,"I work in a dental lab and I have bad noise sensitivity issues. Bad enough to bring anxiety attacks. I was hesitant to buy these because of the price. I tried other ear buds but they did not cancel anything enough. My hubs demanded I buy these and so I did and good lord the peace these have brought me. What sound does make it through is dampened so much that it's barely there and no longer triggers me. I cannot believe that these little things can block SO MUCH. They are so comfortable that I forget I have them in and the cool little bands they have around the bud keeps them in. They ain't going nowhere! They weigh NOTHING. Easy to get them in and remove. I love that the volume control is a swipe on the side of the bud. Also you can tap three times to repeat a song! I find them very good with phone calls too (android). They are VERY sensitive to my touch commands. I don't have to mash the hell out of them to get them to pause, skip or go back.Music and audio books sound brilliant!! I find that the sound from the buds does not have to do battle with any background noise making for an awesome experience. Every other pair of earbuds I have had including Sony's has had to do battle with background noise because they could not cancel squat at my workplace.On the connection issue, I had it. The left one stopped syncing. I tried twice to fix it and twice it stopped syncing. I was a sad panda and almost returned them until my hubs told me the left bud syncs with the right bud so if I was taking the left one out first ( I was taking them both out at the same time), it could be causing an issue. I reset the whole thing. Then I started taking the right on out first and putting it in my ear and waiting for the, battery at blah blah percent prompt then the tone that tells you that it's on. Then I take the left one out of the case and put it in and I have never had another problem and I waited a over solid month of nearly everyday use before I posted this. Not one more problem. If you are reluctant about this issue, just remember you can always return them and get your money back if you can't fix the issue. It's freaking worth a try!!! This is an amazing life altering product that has made an ENORMOUS difference in my anxiety level due to constant bombardment of NOISE.On battery life. At work I keep the earbud case plugged in. When I go on break and lunch, I put them back in the case to charge. I have never had the battery run out on me. I am there for 9 hours.In my opinion these are worth every damn cent. I cannot be without them now. Just remember to take the right one out first and put it in your ear and wait for the tone that tells you it's on. Only then take the left one out.","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2023",AEYU23YL74N5DVNNDC3JSB46XWHQ,True,177,Color: Triple Black

R347URO8ZWP4L5,B0B4PSQHD5,"1.0 out of 5 stars UPDATED REVIEW: Returned, just within the return window",ejbleen,1,"UPDATED REVIEW: Returned to Amazon.Multiple problems cropped up after several days.1) Only the right bud would work.2) The accompanying app refused to acknowledge the existence of my iPad - the iPad that I've used with the buds since I got them. iPad Settings could see the buds, but couldn't connect to them.3) Finally, this morning the buds could ""see"" but would not connect to my Dell Win11 laptop, with which they've worked since I bought them.I did the usual stuff: forget and repair, reset the buds, blah, blah, blah. As you'll understand if you read my original 3 1/2-star review, there is little about Bose support for this device that would tempt me to believe that contacting the company would be any use at all.When the buds work, the sound is good. But my entire user experience has suggested from the start that there is something very wrong with Bose's management of this product, from its design to its documentation and support. This is not a $200+ product - at least, not in my experience. In fairness, your experience may, of course, be different.BTW, the link to the online English user manual for this product is still in French. When I looked at it more closely, I realized that it is not even for the QC buds - it's for some amplifier or other! If I were responsible for product support at Bose, I'd be making it my business to see that Amazon reviews of my product were read and acted on by someone at the company. This relatively minor problem with the online user manual suggests that Bose doesn't read our reviews .... :(ORIGINAL REVIEW: These were my replacement for my Jabra Elite Pro 7 wireless buds, the left of which gave out less than a year after I bought them (just like it did for many unfortunate purchasers).Let me talk about the pros of the Bose earbuds first:1) Excellent fit in the ears;2) Excellent, full, warm sound (though I qualify this a little below);3) Ability to connect to up to 8 devices. The buds remember those devices, so the moment you select the Bose earbuds in your device Bluetooth app they'll connect. Easier than either of my Jabra sets;4) Magnetic, so won't fall out of case;5) Can be ""recognized"" by your device as soon as you open the case - you don't need to take them out;6) Friends says that the call quality on their end is excellent;7) Works fine with Windows devices - something that Jabra still doesn't seem to be able to do;8) The buds appear to remember your various settings even if you use them with a device that doesn't have the app. Very good!9) You can use one earbud (e.g. for phone calls);10) Noise canceling is excellent.A word here about the sound quality, which I wouldn't class as either a pro or a con. The buds seem to me to be very bass-heavy, but in saying that I'm aware that the tight fit of this sort of earbud design is so much a part of bass response that it might be my fit, though it is entirely comfortable, is too tight. I run the bass end of the equalizer at about -4 (db? - there's no volume unit specified).OK, now having said that, the bass response seems to me to extend way down the spectrum in the orchestral music that I listen to. You can almost feel the resonance of the bows on the double-basses, or the movement of the air when the bass drum is struck. Far and away more satisfying than any other in-ear phones, wireless or wired.Now for the cons. Some of these are simply eccentric design decisions. Some of them suggest sloppiness in overall product management or integration into the overall product experience.1) The fit in the case is peculiar. Getting them out requires an odd pinching of forefinger and thumb, and I can't take out the left bud with my right fingers - I have to use the left hand. Similarly, stowing the buds isn't intuitive at all, either in the left-right axis or top-bottom axis. I'll probably get used to it, but it's definitely a little strange. I have the glossy black ones, so there are no tell-tale shadows in the case to guide the eye;2) There doesn't seem to be any obvious way of determining how they work when you first open the package. There's a small QR code, but that gives information about installation, not use. If you go to the Bose website (at the time of my writing this review) and download the user guide in English, it turns out to be in French! And at least one of the web links from the app is dead.3) Controlling the buds involves touching the outside of the buds in various ways: brief touch, long touch, or a slide of the finger. This has the advantage of being ""solid-state"", as opposed to a clickable switch that can wear out. But the buds sit far enough out from the ears that knowing exactly where that ""touchable"" area is to be found can be difficult. And that is a problem, because a tentative slide (change the volume) can be interpreted as a touch (stop/start) - you need to be confident.4) The app is poorly designed. Here's an example: You can connect the buds using your regular Bluetooth connection, although the app supposedly will do it for you. If you have connected without using the app, however, then the app doesn't know you've connected ... and you won't be able to do anything else with the app until that connection takes place. And I've not found out yet how to delete the ""Work"" profile I created at the app's suggestion ....5) There is a young woman in my earbuds, and when she talks to me about battery strength she sounds bored to death. I'm not surprised, since she insists on telling the the name of the device I've connected to, and the default name of Windows devices is a long and incomprehensible string of gibberish ....OK, here's the summary.I like the sound and the fit, and I'm glad I bought them.However, the overall attention to the user experience doesn't suggest Bose to me, or any sort of premium product for that matter. At $149 they'd be a no-brainer. At their present price, which suggests a luxury experience, I think they're too expensive.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2023",AEEMV746AV6KAY2W64D72OPKGGDQ,True,303,Color: Triple Black
R3SJJD9Y53KJI7,B0B4PSQHD5,5.0 out of 5 stars Thrilled with my first pair of wireless earbuds.,P.S. Noonan,5,"This is my very first purchase of wireless earbuds (well, I purchased 3 others at same time, to compare them to each other). I did a decent amount of research in a short period of time, and landed on three of the highest rated. These, the Sony WF-1000XM4 and the Beats Fit Pro. I'll start by stating that I haven't felt compelled enough to actually write a review in years. I was so afraid these would disappoint me based on other reviews and Reddit threads, but after just a couple minutes listening to music with these and the Sony earbuds - I had determined an easy winner. I didn't even bother opening the Beats Fit Pro because I knew there was no way they wound better than Bose. My previous earbuds were Bose Soundsport (a gift from someone), so maybe I just have some bias because I'm accustomed to the sound that Bose delivers. My only other prior experience with ANC wireless earbuds is Apple Airpods Pro (I think first generation?) and all I remember when I tried them is instantly thinking the music quality wasn't even close to my Soundsport. Which is a good segue into my Pros and Cons list.PROS:1. Sound/Music quality. I'm not educated on all the components of sound/music, I don't know the exact science of what's what, I only know what sounds good to me. I know when music sounds ""full bodied"" and that's how I'd describe these/the Bose sound. The bass especially. I love Bose bass.1. Comfort. One of my biggest gripes with the Bose Soundsport was the fit/the wing tips. I HATE the wing tips, even with the smallest size they would cause soreness in my left ear in less than hour. In contrast, I LOVE the way these fit/feel. I have worn them for 3+ hours with zero discomfort. And that's with the size that they came with, I haven't even tried the other sizes yet to see if they can be even more comfortable.2. Noise Cancelling. Again, I'm not highly educated/experienced in this area (Soundsport didn't have ANC), but I can tell these do it well. I blow-dried my hair while listening to music and I couldn't hear the blowdryer at all (I did have my music up to max/near max volume), but still. I did try to compare this feature with Sony's, and either Sony's ANC was malfunctioning (I researched and troubleshooted), or it was just really bad in comparison to Bose.3. Easy set-up/sync. Scanned a QR code, downloaded the app, and boom, I was connected. I've had zero connection issues. (I have a Galaxy S21+).4. Aesthetic. I like how they look. I didn't like the weird knob thingy on the Sony, and I don't like the very obvious ""b"" Beats logo that's on the Bits Fit Pro, so I am extra grateful that I ended up liking these the most, because I also like how they look the most.CONS:1. Hiss/static noise. One of the biggest complaints I saw people have with these is the faint static/hiss noise (when no music/sound is playing), particularly when in Aware mode (ANC turned off). And yes, mine make the noise, and it can be heard even if music is playing at a very low volume, and yes it's annoying, but when I considered how infrequently I would have my earbuds in but not have any music/sound playing (or have volume low enough to hear the static), I determined that's really not a deal breaker for me, and it doesn't outweigh the pros.2. At first they were a little difficult to remove from the case, but I have quickly gotten better at knowing where to grab/how to remove.NEUTRAL FOR NOW/WILL UPDATE LATER:1. Call/mic quality? In my research I also came across a lot of complaints about call quality, people say that the other person on the line can barely hear them/there's a lot of noise, etc. For me, I literally didn't even consider this a factor in my decision making, because I barely care. It's not my primary purpose or use for my wireless earbuds. However, I'll eventually test it out and will update my review later with my experience.2. Touch controls. I'm new to this, so it could just be a learning curve, but every so often I have trouble getting the touch controls to respond or do exactly what I want. I like it, I think it's neat, and I'm sure I'll get better at it, but I also expect touch controls in general to be finicky on occasion.CONCLUSION:While I would recommend these to anyone, I do believe the best choice for everyone is going to be different, and that it's important to know what your priorities are, what annoys you more, etc.For me personally, the primary purpose of my earbuds is for enjoying music for relatively long periods of time, oftentimes while engaging in physical activity/chores, so sound/music quality and comfort are my two greatest priorities, so for my purposes, I am absolutely thrilled with these.","Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2022",AG64UIKDQLPDBRTDD2MI3NXXLV2A,True,256,Color: Soapstone
R2D4Y034W022KB,B0B4PSQHD5,4.0 out of 5 stars Connection issues made me have to return,Chris,4,"Man, I thought I'd found the perfect earbuds and am so bummed I have to return these. A little background: I've been using v1 of the Airpods Pro for about 2.5 years. One of them flaked out last week so I began searching for a replacement. While I'm well within the Apple universe (MacBook Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, iPad Pro, etc) I also use Windows quite a bit. In my search I read dozens of reviews on earbuds, and the vast majority of them almost presumptively point Apple users to the Airpods Pro 2. I get it, in theory everything syncs up and works better. But there were things I didn't like about the Airpods Pro 1 (ANC was mediocre, and particularly bad on a plane; sound quality was meh). So I was actually eager to step outside the Apple box and try something a little more universal. I narrowed my search down to two, and ended up purchasing both the Bose QC II as well as the Airpods Pro 2, with the intent of doing my own use case testing and returning one.Upon receiving and trying both, it took me less than 30 minutes to decide which to keep: The Bose QC II.The ANC on the Airpods 2 was very, very good, but the Bose QC II just took it a couple notches better. As I travel on airplanes quite a bit the ANC was very important to me, and like I said my experience with the original Airpods was lacking.Additionally, after playing a few of my favorite songs with each unit, the Airpods Pro 2 sounded good, but the Bose QC II again came out on top. I'm not an audiophile, but the sound was just richer, with more depth; I heard certain notes in a different way than I ever had with the Airpods.It was at this point that I decided to send the Airpods back, which I did the following day, ready to begin my new and better audio life with the Bose QC II. Everything started out in a state of bliss. Working out of a home office, I could no longer hear my wife working through her accounting problems via Zoom calls in the other room. (FWIW, I also didn't hear her when she came up behind me and asked if I wanted something for lunch). I received a call, and though I fumbled a bit with the controls the first time the call quality was fine, and they seemed to be able to hear me OK.However, the first chink in the armor came just this evening when I tried connecting the Bose QC II to my Windows system in preparation for a call I have tomorrow. Connection via Bluetooth was simple and straightforward. I then went to a news site that I knew had videos and listened. For some reason the sound kept clicking in and out. I thought it might be the connection with the site, so opened Spotify and played a couple of songs. Same issue. I then went to the Bose app on my iPhone, which said it was having trouble connecting, even though it was in fact connected to the PC (albeit a little glitchy).At the end of the day, this last experience seems consistent with so many of the other reviews that I read up here (thank you), and I just don't want to be dealing with this again and again (and especially not after I'm past the return window!). I have no interest in going through a tech support call with Bose or them sending a new pair. For $300 plus tax I shouldn't have to, and these should work more seamlessly. So I'm returning, and I'm not sure what I'm going to replace them with.A few other observations:- The controls for pausing, skipping forward, moving back, volume control, etc. work and are intuitive, however a few times I inadvertently paused music when I was just trying to adjust the earpod. This wasn't the deal killer; I figured in time I'd get used to the sensitivity and figure it out. But it was a little annoying and perhaps some sensitivity adjustments, or more of a haptic-type feel would work better.- The earbuds themselves fit great out of the box. I didn't even try the other sizes. They were very comfortable.- I liked how each time I put the earpods in it told me how much battery was left in each.- The charging case is slightly larger than the Airpods case, but still very pocketable. I could care less that it doesn't support wireless charging, just not a big deal to me. The magnet holding the earpods in also seemed a little stronger than Apple's case, which I really liked because anytime I accidentally dropped the Apple case the earpods would fall out and slide all over the place (wood floors).In summary, again I really, really wanted these to work out. I was so impressed with the ANC and sound quality, and liked how the bass and treble could be adjusted in the Bose app. It's just a shame that it had these connection glitches with my computer system. To be clear, I've read that Bose customer support is good and fair, but again if I have to call customer support to just to properly use a pair of $300 earbuds then something is wrong.UPDATE:So before returning I decided to try one more time with connecting to computer. I shut down all devices (iPad, etc) that were near the computer, to reduce any potential interference. This resolved the issue with the sound breaking out and the earbuds worked fine.I then shut down the computer and reconnected them to the iPhone. All good. However, when I rebooted the computer I somehow lost the connection with the iPhone, and what I was listening to stopped playing. I then looked at the Bose app and it was somewhere in no man’s land, searching for a connection with the earbuds. Only a reboot of the phone got the app out of this mode, and allowed me to reconnect.So… this takes me back to my original point: These are among THE MOST EXPENSIVE earbuds on the market right now. I’m the consumer and it’s not my job, nor interest, to troubleshoot problems and jump through hoops to figure out what’s going on. That should have happened at in the Bose QC department, but from my brief experience combined with all the reviews I’ve read, it seems like something slipped past them.Thank you and God bless.","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2023",AHC7FZHNOZAZMAXQ36FZXGT7IMDA,True,1124,Color: Triple Black
R1BC31YP5VEAIZ,B0B4PSQHD5,5.0 out of 5 stars Truly cancel out 100% of the noise,Wes,5,"These headphones are without a doubt the best headphones I have purchased so far in my entire life. I say thus far, because I know that technology is able to continue to become greater and greater as we advance through time, but as of 2023 these headphones are so packed with technology that they meet every need that I could want out of headphones, and additionally have some extra really cool perks.I want to talk first about the number one need that I wanted these headphones to meet. They claimed that they had 100% noise canceling and I can confirm that that is absolutely correct. Closing out the loud outside world is something that is real true need of mine. I live in a major city, and everything is so loud that I can barely concentrate. I can't go to the grocery store, out to eat, for a walk down the road, or sometimes even sit in my own home without having some sort of overpowering noise that I don't want to hear.So here's how these headphones work noise canceling-wise. I'll give you two scenarios.Scenario one, I have had a hard day and had to talk to people all day. I'm hungry, tired, don't want to talk to anyone or hear anyone's voices. I go to my favorite fish restaurant because I'm too tired to cook but I know that I'm going to need some peace and quiet when I get there. I place my food order, then sit down at my table in a very noisy environment with lots of peoples conversations going in the background. Relaxation is just about to begin. I take out my Bose headphones, I insert one into my ear, and then immediately I hear this sound that sounds like a lightsaber. That's the Microphones in the headphones testing the ear seal to make sure sound doesn't get into the headphones. I insert the second headphone into my other ear, and hear another lightsaber like sound. For about two more second I can still hear peoples voices and then all of the sudden I hear a ""beep"" and everyone's voices fade away! The noise cancelling has kicked in, and it's time for me to enjoy my dinner with some relaxing peaceful music. I'm now sitting in the middle of a restaurant and I can only hear my music and no one's voices at all. Sometimes I'll turn my music off in the middle of the restaurant, and I'll watch funny Instagram videos in the headphones. Usually after a 20 minute meal and some funny videos, I'm so relaxed and happy even after a hard day's work, that I'm ready to go home and go to sleep.Scenario two. I live next to a very busy major street. I can hear lots of road noise, exhaust, loud stereos, and many other kinds of noises. I like to take walks and relax. It's not very relaxing walking when I have to hear a lot of these noises. I insert my bose headphones , and all of the road noises fade away. All I can hear once again is my music. I have to make sure that I stay on the sidewalk when walking, because these headphones cancel out noise so well that if I try to walk on the road, I'll likely get hit by a car because I will not hear the cars driving near me.So that being said, the main thing I love about these is the noise canceling. I mentioned that there were couple cool extra things about these that I wanted to tell you about. I do like the amount of bass that these headphones are able to produce. It's way more than I expected. Additionally the clarity on these headphones is so good that I can can barely describe it in words. There is a treble mode, and a bass mode within the app so I can choose between these two modes and intensify the kind of clarity and or bass that I'd like.The charging case is a medium to small size. It fits well then my pants pocket and doesn't get in the way when I'm in the gym. That's one other thing that I wanted to make sure I told you about, is that these are the perfect headphones for the gym. I've seen several other people in the gym with them on, and now I know why. They don't move around in my ears at all! I work out very intensely, and if headphones were going to move around then they would move around on me. They stay exactly where I put them even though I'm sweating on them non-stop for over an hour each day.I love everything about these headphones. My only regret is that I let the price of these scare me away for so long, and I didn't order them soon enough.","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2023",AF2A6IMIAJKTHBAN5QBBJB6WPP6A,True,268,Color: Soapstone
R2P70ALFPIY65H,B0B4PSQHD5,3.0 out of 5 stars So promising but a step backwards in comfort and connectivity,D. Frost,3,"I really, really wanted to like these. I have the previous models which I really loved but I figured with a new model it must be better in every way. When I first got them, that seemed to be the case. the noise canceling was definitely an improvement. The audio quality was also improved. The comfort was good but not great. However, as time went on, I find that this new fit system just doesn’t work for me in my right ear. I’ve switched back-and-forth between all the sizes of the earplug and wing but overtime the right one just finds its way out of my ear and will literally fall out of my head. for an expensive pair of earbuds, This can be kind of annoying. No … very annoying. I really think Bose should’ve stuck with the previous fit system and improved upon it as opposed to going back to a more traditional wing system. The old system, while not perfect was very comfortable and never fell out of my head. So it’s truly unfortunate that this new model is better in someways and worse in others. Another issue is there is also synchronicity issues for the first few minutes after you put them on. The older model did not have this problem at all. I suspect this is because Bose caved under pressure to get independent channels to each ear and this causes some issues because this wasn’t happening until they updated the buds to support independent listening with either bud. As time goes by these are getting progressively worse and I should’ve just stuck with the previous model , which makes the previous model a great deal to buy. If you just want a really good pair of noise canceling earbuds, the noise canceling isn’t quite as good as this model but it’s more than adequate so I would say, save yourself some money and buy the previous model. I hope Bose goes back to the previous design and makes it a bit lighter and more compact instead of going with this new model wing system because it’s just not as good as the old one. It’s also more complicated and harder to get a good fit. Given the higher price and a step back on quality, I I am doing a pretty low score, but this is because the previous model is better and this one was more expensive so comparatively the previous mall gets five stars but this one gets three.P.S. Whoever’s idea it was to make the bottom of the case round so that you can never stand it on end? What? Considering that you have to leave the case open while checking status and setting up Bluetooth? It’s this kind of design decision that just begs the question, what were you thinking Bose?","Reviewed in the United States May 21, 2023",AFDPIRS4MY4CH5UTHCK72KKU6ALA,True,13,Color: Soapstone
RG5FCOUPWYR88,B0B4PSQHD5,2.0 out of 5 stars Physical product Nice sound/ noise cancelling. TERRIBLE software/ connection issues.,Kindle Customer,2,"Bought these back in February on sale for $250 after my Jaybirds (I had for nearly 5 years) finally bit the dust. As someone who uses earbuds daily for work, home, and gym; God knows how many hours I had on my Jaybirds listening to music, podcasts, and audio books. I actually felt sad when they broke and had huge expectations with these Bose. They're the first Bose I've ever had and I REALLY wanted to love these.The first month-ish they were great! Getting a new piece of tech years ahead of your previous, you really notice the sound quality, noise cancellation, batter life, and quick charge features. Unfortunately, that was were the good news stopped.Immediately, I noticed the right earbud is like the main unit. They won't operate independently while the right earbud is in the case which was a bummer not having that feature anymore, since I had this from a product years older, but not a dealbreaker for me.The BIGGEST problem is the connection issues. The software/ Bluetooth in these SUCK. You could have the greatest speakers and noise cancellation features in an earbud ever and it doesn't mean a damn thing if they don't actually connect/ work properly.I've had all manner of problems on this front from the earbuds not connecting in general, to the left/right speaker individually not connecting, or going-out/dropping randomly. Sometimes they'll be working just fine, until you pause whatever you're listening to and then you lose the sound/ connection and have to reset the Bluetooth connection/ put them back in the case and take them out again to get the sound back. There have been times when you place them in your ear and they register they're connected via the echo sound and voice saying so, only for you to wait 10-45 seconds for the sound to actually come through the speakers. I can go on-and-on about this forever, like every other month some new problem with the connection appears.I have a Galaxy S22 ultra so one of the newest/top end phones at the time as I believe the 23s were just about to roll out as I got these earbuds. Kept everything up to date, only device paired, have unpaired and cleared the cache then re-paired with the device, and every other trick Bose recommends on their website for troubleshooting the connection issues... It's still an ongoing issue that has been such a frustration.Another issue I've found was they never stayed in your ears very well. Moving your head suddenly or side-to-side can easily cause them to fall out. I switched the earpieces to the largest size that it comes with but still have problems now and again. I'm sure its a personal thing with the earpiece sizes and you could order 3rd party earpieces that fit better to solve this issue but with the connection issues being what they are, I never bothered investing more $ in a defective product.This leads me to my last issue though, due to previous issues, I never used these earbuds for the gym/ working out/ running. So you'd think that would cut a lot of wear and tear down on the product. Yet, come October here and the hinge on the top cover of the case gave out and broke off. Luckily the magnets on the earbuds are strong enough to keep them in place in the case to not fall out while in your pocket. But that was it, roughly 8 months of ownership and the case already gave out which caused me to come back and write this review.When they work, they work great, but unfortunately that was short-lived in my case. If you wana roll the dice good luck!Personally, its been such a let down and pain that I will never buy another pair of Bose again after this.","Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2023",AFQGMDQY5LOBQ3NNHNWVBZWW6BBA,True,38,Color: Triple Black
R183MPT8IUPDQJ,B0B4PSQHD5,4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Sound and Noise Cancellation With Minor Connectivity Issues,Luis A. Almaguer,4,"I hate to give these earbuds only four stars because they do have incredible sound and offer amazing noise cancellation, but they do have some small shortcomings. On the positive side, they are super comfortable. Also, the sound on these earbuds is so good that I once had to pause a movie that I was watching because I thought there was someone else in the room, only to realize that I was actually hearing the background conversation from two other characters in the movie 😂. Similarly, I use them for work, and I have had coworkers tap me on the shoulder because they had been talking to me and I had not noticed at all.On the negative side, for some reason, I keep experiencing connectivity issues. To be fair, these issues are more of an annoyance than a serious problem--in my opinion--and very easily corrected. The ""biggest"" issue in this sense is that whenever I switch from one of my devices to another the new device sometimes does not recognize the earbuds, and I have to reset them to go through the entire paring process again. The problem only occurs about 20% of the time, but it is still quite annoying--especially when I'm about to go for a run and I have to spend several minutes fixing it. All in all, though, I would still choose these earbuds over all the other brands I've used, including both Apple's and Samsung's earbuds. Oh, and did I mention how awesome the sound is 😆...","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AGQZOKGAVE472Y47FUZ6AK5TFZNA,True,1,Color: Triple Black
RLOAIEW80E01M,B0B4PSQHD5,4.0 out of 5 stars Good performance and stay in well but quirky controls,Dennis P Van Wormer,4,"Good sound quality with fairly good noise cancellation (about the best I expect from ear buds), but the controls are often quirky. Turning noise cancellation off and on works fairly well, but turning sound off and on is not very consistent. And using the ear buds for volume control does not seem to work for me, even though the owner's guide states it is a control option. However, cannot find any actual instructions on setting up noise control. Although the ear buds fit well, I find myself trying not to adjust them in my ears for fear of the controls taking over when I just want to push the ear bud in slightly. Also, the two ear buds occasionally lose sync. Finally, I use them with both my iPhone and iPad, and I have to almost always go to the blue tooth setup to turn one device off and the other device on manually. My older Bose ear buds that were wired NEVER had a problem with syncing or which device I wanted (obviously).","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2024",AETDNLSZ44EMHP5KAGKLPBIURNIA,True,0,Color: Triple Black

R1CZOXBYV4UMN8,B0B4PSQHD5,2.0 out of 5 stars Not as good as original Quiet Comfort Earbuds,Kindle Customer,2,"First the positives!1. The earbuds are smaller2. They're lighter3. The case is smaller and lighter and easier to fit into a pocket. (love this actually)and thats about it.I'm going to discuss the default settings for these QCII earbuds - and there's a reason that I'll get to later in this review.The negatives1. They don't fit as well as their predecessors. The ear canal piece and the outer ring just don't fit the same and are not nearly as comfortable - though they are lighter - they hurt my ears within minutes (yes I tried the different sizes)2. They don't seal as well as the original Quiet Comfort earbuds. Period.3. The sound has too much bass (bass makes everything sound more awesome-r right?!) - the default sound equalization is just not as good when compared to the original Bose QC earbuds. I would need to have a separate software eq now, which I am not going to do.4. The default noise cancelling is not as good as the originals (imo). There are only 2 default settings for ANC now, instead of the original version which had 3 - high, mid, low ANC. Bose thought that extra default settings for the QCII weren't necessary. This is probably a way to ""encourage"" users to sign up and create an account using a mobile device - which I can't do anyway because I have a MacBook!5. THE WORST - and a word of warning for MacOS users - There is NO, zero, zip, zilch, nada, Apple Store APP to set these up! The app is only for Google or iPhones! There is no way to get the functionality from these that you need, without an iPhone or an Android phone running the Bose app!To be fair I can take some responsibility by not doing sufficient research about how to control the new QCII earbuds. I believe that Bose hobbled the default functions intentionally, especially when compared to the original QC earbuds, to force users and data collection through their iOS and Android app. I will probably just deal with it. I don't want to return them but they're not the old original QC earbuds, and they are just not as good, so they'll prob go to someone else.I really was looking forward to getting an updated/upgraded set of earbuds and these sure let me down. I might end up returning them now that I keep mulling on it. I'm just not happy at all with these things. I'll try and make an update in a week or so of use to see if my opinion changes, but with the hobbled functionality I'm not going to hold my breath.edit and update:I tried and tried to like these, but the user interface is so horrible, and the lack of functionality with Windows and MacOS is a deal breaker. (confirmed by Bose customer support)I have no way to control these, and the user interface, in regards to tapping the ear pieces to perform an action, is really really bad. The old version would accept a double tap to change the ANC settings and it worked very quickly. The new version takes probably 10 seconds to get the earbuds to a state where I could hear a conversation with a person, and that's just not acceptable.I will be returning these. 2 stars because they are much lighter, and the smaller case - but no wireless charging and the terrible user interface (touch tapping and touch holding on the ear pieces) combined with no way to adjust the earbuds settings without an android device or an iPhone is just a hard no. Can't do it.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AHZYEKPEDIN5BGAP5SHVFOCWCY3A,True,0,Color: Triple Black

R8P8WII8HBQI0,B0B4PSQHD5,3.0 out of 5 stars These are the best headphones on the market 4/23,Maximus Joseppi,3,"Edit: They have finally glitched out and died on me. I do stand by that these are the best ear buds as far as hardware is concerned but their software is bad-borderline terrible. After 11 months they just wouldn't connect anymore but Bose did honor their warranty and even send me ultras as a nice gesture.. but they had so many connectivity issues throughout my year with them, very often having to do a hard reset to clear whatever glitch was going on. They also don't have an ANC off mode??? There's no excuse for it and it makes these earbuds totally useless in windy conditions, on a boat, car with the windows down, bike, motorcycle etc... bose.... Take 10 minutes to add an off setting to these buds in the software. There's already code for it since they turn off when you put them in the case or take them out of your ear... Let us turn them off. Worst feature and they didn't change it for the ultrasAs of April 2023, these are by far the best ear buds on the planet. I live in my ear buds.. every day, almost all day I have them in watching videos and streams and some music so I always splurge on what the reviews say are the best. I had the Sony XM4s for 13 months and I used them every day until their battery very quickly went from lasting 6 hours to 4 to literally 1 hour. Their warranty is 12 months and at 12 months and 1 day, they won't honor it. Had to throw them away after 13 months.I was extremely impressed with those so I was actually shocked when I first put these QC 2s in my ears...-The noise cancelling is revolutionary. Like, actually a game changer. I have $1200 noise cancelling aviation headsets and they don't come close to these never mind the XM4s. It makes every other noise cancelling I've experienced seem like a gimmick toy by comparison, it's actually a strange sensation is so amazing.-the sound isn't even comparable to anything else. These are night and day way better than the XM4s and every other ear buds I've ever heard. The base actually sounds like a crisp powerful sub woofer with in depth deep powerful notes when listening to explosions or music. It's just a powerful and full sound without any lacking areas.-they are extremely comfortable, so were the XM4s. It's kind of a wash here because I could have both in my ears for 10 hours and be happy and I probably readjust them just as often as any other bud at the gym.-they look cool, better than the girlie XM4s that had that rose gold jewelry look that I had to sand down and paint black. These are masculine and nice right from Bose. On the bigger side but couldn't care less for the noise cancelling and auditory performance.-the app and controls kinda suck, not going to lie. Had some connectivity issues with the app and had to reset the buds for it to connect to them. You need the app to connect to them change any settings.. I find it annoying that you can't turn the controls off or customize any of the touch shortcuts. I had much cheaper buds with completely customizable touch controls and the app would let you turn off all or any singular touch control you don't want for any situation. Bose, epic hardware, just hire one good software guy too.-the only actual problem and complaint I have with these are you can't turn off the noise cancelling or noise enhancing feature entirely. If you are on a motorcycle or in heavy wind, noise cancelling buds give loud feedback and the XM4s allowed you to turn that off but still get audio, these are always on.Again, epic hardware, hire a software guy.Overall, nothing even comes close to these ear buds regardless of the mediocre software attached to them that you will almost never use after initial setup. That being said, they should solve that issue cause it's not very hard to do and for $300 and the best hardware on the market, a good fully customizable software program to go with them would really seal the deal and complete the package.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2023",AG7JPX7SAUTMR6GE2GQMDJX74KLA,True,235,Color: Triple Black
R2VBQEAXSON0WD,B0B4PSQHD5,3.0 out of 5 stars One of the flimsiest feeling cases and some of the least consistent software,Josh rizzolo,3,"I want to like these headphones. I love their sound quality, noise cancelling, ear fit, and touch controls. All great. The touch controls specifically stand out against things like the Galaxy buds+ which I owned last. Touches on the ear are registered well, as are the small ""gestures"" to change volume (Swipe up and down on the ear).That being said, two things that define the true-wireless headphone experience more than anything else for me are the case and the user experience. Firstly, the case is fully plastic with a very light lid. Build quality just feels distinctly low for the price point here. It doesn't seem like it always forces the headhphones down into the charging position, as sometimes they stay connected to my phone when in the case, despite full case battery. The case isn't horrible, but it stands out as disappointing against more reasonably priced earbuds from years ago (again, the first Galaxybuds+). I won't complain about case battery life or ease of use though. It is simple to activate pairing mode with the case, and I don't run out of battery in it like I did with my old earbuds.The user experience is really the thing I have the most gripe with. By user experience, I specifically mean the seamlessness with which the headphones connect and sync with the phone when a connection is started. For the most part, it's not bad. Taking both earbuds out of the case and putting them in your ears at once works well most of the time. However, I have had consistent issues using the left earbud by itself. These issues are unique to the left (at least for my pair) with the right functioning almost as expected on its own. The times I do have connection issues with both buds, however, they are more persistent than with any other pair of headphones I have yet owned. Sometimes I put them in my ears and they connect, but I hear nothing no matter what I do. In the end, the only way I have consistently fixed this is to unpair them from my phone and restart my phone. Only then can I try to repair. I have not found another sequence that works, despite multiple resets, unpairs, trying one earbud or the other, checking my volume, etc. It's truly annoying to have to deal with this at this price. Thankfully, this could be a software issue, and thus could be patched. Fingers crossed.In the same vein, the app needs some large updates. While it mostly works well, the devil is in the details. No matter what I do, the headphones don't actually seem to remember the mode they were last in when I put them back in my ears. Ok, not horrible. Can't change the default mode of the single earbud either as far as I have found. Still not horrible but getting annoying. The worst part, however, is that the app will read that the earbuds are in a mode they are not in very often on startup. Seems like the app doesn't read the mode from headphones on start. This means, if you want to change the mode to noise cancelling for one earbud in the app you must change the mode from quiet (default on the app despite not being the default for single earbud) to aware, and back to quiet to get the noise cancelling. You can also change modes via the touch functions on the earbud, which doesn't require this annoying switch and switch back behavior.No dealbreakers here. Overall good headphones with good sound, noise cancelling, and battery. But, competing at the $250+ price point, the build quality of the case and the software polish are disappointing. Were I to go back, I'd try a different new pair of earbuds, likely from Sony as I like their overear and their earbud cases.","Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2024",AFDZWOVHPLFWH6ONZK2DW7WHBYAA,True,2,Color: Triple Black

This is a great device, but it's kind of ruined by the fact that the software is so poorly implemented. Usually when I read reviews that talk about connectivity issues or software problems, I just assume it's user error and that the problem wouldn't ever happen to me. That is not the case here. The software is genuinely bad. There genuinely are connectivity issues. Not so much the headphones have a hard time pairing with my phone (yet), but rather simply that the app can only access the settings for the headphones, or even find the headphones, about 20% of the time.In a lot of use cases that doesn't really matter. This is a new toy, however, and I kind of want to play with the settings. You know, it would be nice to know exactly what this thing can and can't do. Can't figure that out if I can't access it in the app.I'm thinking about returning. Honestly, I don't want to because the hardware is so very good. The noise cancellation is truly superb. Reference point for me would be the pixel buds pro and Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2. Also pixel buds hey series, but those don't have ANC, so as a reference point... I'm not really sure how it serves.Anyway, I think I might have no choice but to return if the software update (which is really hard to apply without being able to access settings in the app) doesn't fix the problems and having, which incidentally have everything to do with...

I already have the Sony WF-SP800N earbuds, but the Bose are better in both categories! But where I like the Sony better than Bose is, the sony buds will auto connect to the last device I was connected to, and the Bose only seem to auto connect to my phone but only if it were the last thing I was connected to before putting them back in charging case. Idk if I’m doing something wrong, but I don’t think so.THE BAD: with the Bose is a few times the left bit would not play anything at all. I’d reset it over and over again with no luck! Then it would work fine the next day. Actually, I don’t even currently have the Bose earbuds possession bc the left earbud all of a sudden started blasting static and then a very loud crackling noise started happening that made me tense up and jerk the earbud out of my ear bc it hurt my ear pretty bad. The crackling wasn’t constant, but it happened every couple seconds and even with volume turned down it was loud! And this pretty much made the left Bud useless. I don’t think anything but the static and cracks sound was coming out of it.The GOOD NEWS - Bose seems to have a pretty good customer service/warranty bc I did a few clicks on their website explaining issue and they’re replacing these QC 2s with Pair of the ULTRAS!! So while it sux to have to go without the buds after paying that price for them at least I’m getting an upgrade and I still have the Sony’s to hold me over. The Sony’s are bulky, but I actually still really like them and these 800s (I don’t think they make them anymore) NEVER fall out of my ear!

R37FAQRSJF2RYW,B0B4PSQHD5,5.0 out of 5 stars The first ANC earbuds that actually are noise-cancelling when you need it,theleeshow,5,"Browsing my order history going back to 2015 I've had 4 pairs of cheap wired earbuds.My favorite headphones are the Sony over ear WH-1000XM4. I tried the WH-1000XM5's and still liked the older model better. The Sony's spoiled me for their noise-cancelling ability. I fly for work almost every week. When I got this job the first thing I did was research headphones and picked up the 1000XM2's and loved them.I've been hunting for a pair of wireless noise-canceling earbuds for a few years. I tried Samsung Galaxy Buds Live, Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Plus, Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2, Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds, SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds Pro, and now these Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II.I wasn't expecting much from the Samsungs and they lived up to my expectations. I returned them. The Sennheisers were the greatest sounding earbuds I have ever heard, but they were uncomfortable and the noise cancelling was poor. The Sony earbuds were also poor at noise cancelling and didn't sound that great to my ears, especially compared to the over the ear models I love. They were also finicky and uncomfortable.I never seriously considered the Bose options in the headphones / earbuds game. ""No highs, no lows, must be Bose."" The Bose sound has always been my least favorite. Clear, midrange, just baffling why people like it. Maybe my ears are damaged, but just not for me. Then I read a review. I took the plunge. No kidding - the noise cancelling on these is as good as the Sony over the ear models.My test for noise cancelling is taking the earbuds for a walk. I do a few miles around the neighborhood every day - and after the Sony's entered my life, the 'clomp clomp clomp' of my footsteps with any other earbud/headphone has driven me crazy. I put these on last night and played a few tracks on TIDAL Master quality - Beatles, Prince, some classical, and there it was. That midrange Bose sound that drives me batty. I switched between these and the Sony's - and the Sony's sound great with no tweaking. They just sound great. I have fallen in love with pipe organ recordings because of the Sony's I think. I love the way the recordings sound and feel in the Sony's. No way these Bose are going to cross this hurdle of sounding like Bose. It's just what they are, not my taste.This morning I tweaked the EQ on my phone to make the Bose less Bose-sounding, and started on my walk, and I couldn't hear my footsteps. I COULDN'T HEAR MY 'CLOMP CLOMP CLOMP.' Oh my goodness. Why do these have to be Bose! These things are a miracle. A MIRACLE. So I dug into my phone's sound settings a little more and saw they have different sound settings for people, depending on their age. I clicked on my age (none of your business!) and the Bose sounded better. More in line with what I'm used to. I played a pipe organ piece and it didn't sound as full as the Sony's but it was fine. It passed my test.I have read the Bose doesn't use the fancy high quality codecs the Sony's use. I could hear sound degradation on quieter passages of a classical recording - but I looked at the recording and it was on a not top-tier label, so maybe it was just an average recording. But the bottom line is- after returning several pair of earbuds for the reasons spelled out above, I am actually going to keep these.I discovered the Bose app has it's own EQ which tweaks the sound a little better than my phone's. There is also a mode where it cancels the sound I want canceled ('clomp clomp clomp'), yet I could hear cars approaching and my feet crinkling leaves in the street.

There’s been plenty of times that i’ll pop the right earbud in my ear and it fails to connect. I have to then troubleshoot by closing apps that i’m trying to listen content from, putting earbud(s) back into the case and back out. Opening up the Bose app and trying to connect through that. And sometimes i’ll have to remove the device off of my bluetooth list and do the reconnecting all over again. And even then it might not connect. so you’re just trying to get it to connect to your device over a period of time. Quite annoying.

R53FMVL6HJIEG,B0B4PSQHD5,2.0 out of 5 stars EDITED BECAUSE OF MANUFACTURER WARRANTY Very disappointed for the first time with a Bose product,Jordan Bowen,2,"My original review of this product wasn’t great to say the least but I do want to add this info as I just completed my warranty claim with Bose on these earbuds and I’m very happy with the outcome. My original review is still available below and although I do still have the same feelings for this exact product, the problem was rectified by the manufacturer. I contacted Bose with the issue I was having and was emailed a shipping label to return the earbuds and was offered their newest model (Quiet Comfort Ultra) as a replacement. Within 7 business days of me sending my earbuds in to Bose I have received the new product which came brand new in the original packaging and for this I’m beyond grateful. I decided to leave my original two star rating however because it pertains to the original earbuds that were a nightmare. If I were to review the new model they had sent as a replacement it would be 5 stars though!Original Review (before warranty replacement)Let me start by saying that I am a huge Bose fan and would consider myself very loyal to the brand. The very first product I purchased was the 3-2-1 home entertainment system probably around 17 years or so ago and since then if it has anything to do with speakers for me, it is most definitely a Bose product. This even includes my vehicle which I am thrilled that Cadillac always have Bose speakers installed. As for earbud headphones, I started with the Bose SoundSport model and they were great. Unfortunately, after almost a year and a half of heavy use the batteries were shot and only lasted about 30 minutes on a full charge so I upgraded to the Quiet Comfort model which I also loved. Unfortunately, after owning those for a year the glue that held them together began to break down and one of them separated into two pieces and would no longer play sound. For the amount I use these, I don't think that them only lasting a year was that bad. I basically wear them for at the least an hour every single day and most days 4+ hours. It was after the Quiet Comforts fell apart that I purchased these Quiet Comfort II series earbuds and the first thing I noticed was that there didn't seem to be much of an upgrade in sound quality or at least it wasn't as noticeable as the upgrade from the SoundSports to the first Quiet Comfort model. After a few days of using them they began to constantly lose connection to my iPhone & iPad and most of the time when this happens, a simple reset won't fix the issue and they refuse to connect to any of my devices. Ive tried everything to correct this when it happens, forget them in my phone's settings, erase them from my Bose Music app, etc. Nothing corrects it other than time. After a few hours of being in their case they will connect again after being removed but this is happening more frequent than not and it is extremely annoying. They also very recently started doing this thing where the sound gets all distorted while using them and then it will start playing sound from only one side for a few seconds and then it will switch to the other side and back continuously for a minute or so. It just really shocks me that I had absolutely zero complaints on any of my previous Bose earbud models and here I am having a nightmare of a time with these Quiet Comfort IIs. I did notice there is a new series/model out now(Quiet Comfort Ultra) and I really wish my Quiet Comfort 1s lasted just another two months or so as I would've just purchased whatever the newest model was at that time but to now spend another $300.00 +/- after just spending $275.00 on these only four months ago is very upsetting as well as the thought that the new model might also not be the same tremendous quality that I believed my previous Bose ear buds were. To tie up this review, I can't say enough good things about Bose products, however I would personally stay away from this model as they've been nothing but issues for me since the very first few times that I used them.","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2024",AFUYAUYXNK257JQFNFKKMMXVXP6A,True,5,Color: Eclipse Grey
RRYLC0AQ4BQJE,B0B4PSQHD5,4.0 out of 5 stars Best sound quality but……,Zay rodriguez,4,"I’ll start with how amazing the sound quality is out of these earbuds, best wireless earbud sound quality I’ve heard, I compared to AirPods gen 1. AirPods Pro gen 1 and 2. But for $300 when comparing to AirPods Pro 2, AirPods takes it. I wear earbuds all day for 4-6 hours at a time, I’m a automotive technician so I would use the noise cancellation features quite a bit. I do love that the noise cancellation is adjustable, and both the AirPods Pro 2 and Bose quitecomfort 2 have a adaptive transparency mode that allows all noise in but protects from noises above 90 decibels, which in the automotive industry is pretty much every air tool we use. When Bose activates this feature it sounds robotic and changes your listening audio, makes it sound odd for a second or two, apple is much smoother when their adaptive transparency works. Also many more features with the apple earbuds, from 3 charging methods and find my features, Bose only has one which is cable charging. AirPods can completely turn off transparency or noise cancellation, Bose cannot. My biggest reason for ultimately choosing AirPods pro2 was the comfort, the Bose earbuds began to chaff my ears after about 1.5 hours, the AirPods I can go for 5+ before I notice any discomfort. So side by side with features the apple AirPods will win this hands down, but… if you’re an audiophile, the sound quality you get from Bose is unbeatable and apple doesn’t come close, also the adjustability of degree of noise cancellation is a fantastic Bose feature, but other than that, the AirPods won me out, mainly due to their integration into iOS UI. I’m sure if I had a android I would stick with the Bose option but apple made sure the AirPods work flawlessly with their iOS devices. Last thing I will mention, maybe it was just my set, but they were a bit buggy. What happened was, in 5 days of owning, they connected 6 times but played no audio, I had to set them back in their case and start over for that to remedy, also for the first 15 seconds after you put them in, the tap controls are very buggy, either severely delayed response or nos response, once they’ve been in Your ears for over a minute they work perfect. Last annoyance was using tap controls, when using it’s almost like an even slight tap on the earbuds is amplified and is obnoxiously loud, I thought maybe I was tapping too hard, but with AirPods gen 1, which are all tap controlled, the action of tapping on the side produces no real noise. I’m telling you, the tap on the side sounds like a balloon popping at a distance of 15-20 ft away every time, it was very difficult to overlook that during my use. You literally have to delicately tap the side to have no audio discomfort, with AirPods I will literally tap with my buckles if my hands are dirty and I get no audible discomfort, no shockingly loud tap, so I don’t know if it is physically transferring the noise in or the noise transparency is interpreting the tapping as a noise and just amplifying this for your ears, either way it’s highly annoying and was the ultimate deal breaker for me.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2022",AFZDLR4QANPSZ6DPCD7VDABOL65Q,True,152,Color: Triple Black

Unfortunately, I was disappointed to discover that they are very difficult to fit into my ears in such a way that they will reliably stay put while exercising or walking. They require a ""twist"" to sort of lock into place, and none of the provided inserts seem to work for my ears. Any jostling, especially if you're at all sweaty, will cause them to work loose and fall out. What's more, they rely on a tight ""seal"" in the ear for the noise cancelling to really work, and that can be very hard to achieve. After buying them, I located my old ones, so I've had a chance to compare them side-by-side by going back and forth, and I honestly prefer my old ones to these. These do have slightly better sound quality, and perhaps better battery life, but honestly what does that matter if they don't stay put?

I was genuinely surprised about the sound quality and immediate bass that hits you right off the bat, and that's without the bose app EQ. Speaking of the app, the app is complete garbage. It did not identify the headphones at all to pair with my phone and it wasn't until the last second of giving up that it finally paired. Honestly after using the EQ settings to keep them at my preferred sound I deleted the app immediately. The microphone quality is super questionable as well. Whenever you're in a call it'll pick up every single sound around you no matter how loud and it'll transfer it to the receiving end of the person you're in a call with, making it very hard to deal with and them not being able to hear any word you say. It also drops bluetooth pairing pretty frequently which made me think it was the pair of headphones I had received. But it wasn't, it's this model in general, I have the same issue even with the new pair. Be careful being around very loud sudden noises too, the mic will try to dim the audio but in return it'll basically pop your ear drum in the process. Overall I do kinda regret buying these headphones although sound quality and build quality is exceptional. I feel like there are way better headphones out there with no issues at all at the same price point that don't use a garbage app.","Reviewed in the United States May 1, 2024",AFSM26I4HZGW2UNMR5UJUL5QVB7Q,True,3,Color: Triple Black

R4LWGICS5DGTT,B0B4PSQHD5,3.0 out of 5 stars Works Wonderfully Until It Doesn't,Amazon Customer,3,"I really liked these earbuds for about 3 months, liked them modestly for 2 months, tolerated them for 2 more months and then had to send them back when they stopped working today. When they work, which is irregularly, they are the best noise cancelling earbuds I've used bar none and I've used pretty much everything made by Sony, Samsung and Bowers & Wilkins. They are a bit bass heavy but that can be equalized out when listening to music. The major problems are three different connection issues and then eventually the death of the right ear bud. First, they don't sit well in the case which meant I had to adjust the stabilizer band and often tap the right ear bud to make sure it was seated. If not, you will lose the ability to connect to anything as everything connects through the right ear bud. Second, I would lose the left earbud sound at least 3x per week mostly when going from WiFi to cellular coverage. That would be fixed by putting the earbuds in the case for 10 seconds and then putting them back on. However, even that would occasionally lead to loss of the left earbud multiple times on a 15 minute walk. If I charged them for more than 2 hours, I would also often lose the left ear bud connection.About once every 1-2 weeks, I'd have to hard reset these, which meant that I would have delete the QC Earbuds ii from the app and the phone and then charge the case and hold the connection button for 25 seconds while doing so. The issue here is that if you don't have a USBc cable with you that you can use to charge the case, this won't work. You would then re-pair the device through the app and to the phone and then it would work. However, the last time I did that today, it would no longer connect to anything as the right ear bud won't recognize the contact in the case.Finally, the app is garbage. About 20% of the time even when working to play music the app didn't recognize the earbuds. I have a bunch of Bose products that have lasted forever. This one is really disappointing, which is made worse by the fact that it is really a wonderful device when it works.Update: I sent them back and received a new set of earbuds that for the past month have worked fine. For these, I've taken three different new approaches. I don't use them with any other device except my cellular phone. I found that they would often drop the connection if I had another device paired to the earbuds that was on. I don't do that any longer. I purchased a case to put the case in as I've found that dropping the case causes the earbuds to lose their ability to sit in the case which makes these no longer functional. Finally, I'm very careful when handling these buds as they don't tolerate being dropped. With this approach so far so good so I'm upping my rating to three stars for now.","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2023",AE3HC6ISD5SQKWVADKKALOSAHMNA,True,49,Color: Soapstone

I finally decided it down to these and Beats Fit Pro. I really like these and honestly between the two you really can't tell much difference. The noise cancelation is a tiny bit better in the Bose, but the sound and bass response is better in the Beats. It honestly came down to one deciding factor, the button to change songs and control the ear buds. On the Beats you actually have a bottom you can feel that clicks instead of the Bose where you just touch the outside. Obviously with the Beats, it's very responsive with the button feel, the Bose were actually more difficult to control. Sometimes when you pressed it twice to change the song it would put it on pause, and pressing it three times would only change the song to the next track instead of repeating or taking you back a track. The Beats seem to fit a bit better than the Bose as well. Also, the Beats were $50 cheaper, honestly not a deal breaker either way, but it was added to the pros when I started adding everything up against the two. Overall my choice after about a week of comparing the two were the Beats. I actually really wanted to like the Bose more, because I have grown up with Bose and always had their products, but at the end of the day Beats came out on top.

The microphone quality is not the best but it is an acceptable fault in light of how good they are at sound quality and noise cancellation. There is only so much that can be expected in terms of microphone ability from an earbud so I cannot fault these for not being the best in that regard. The noise cancellation is more than a little impressive from an earbud and the sound quality is impeccable. Have owned for nearly a year and have been completely satisfied and impressed. Use them multiple hours a day at work and at the gym/running. They stay in place well while moving around and the battery life is pretty solid for an ANC earbud.

RTWA2E2SLE1RK,B0B4PSQHD5,3.0 out of 5 stars Perfect - Until You Update to Latest Firmware,Paul T.,3,"I have always been a fan of the original Bose QuietComfort Earbuds which I have enjoyed for a few years. When I temporarily misplaced them I decided to pull the trigger on the new Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II. When I first got them I was stunned! The sound quality was amazing, surpassing the already incredible first generation. The resolution was so good I was picking up nuances of sound never heard before in songs I had listened to for many years. The noise cancelling was even better than the first generation. The bass left me wondering how there could be so much impact happening inside my ear. Sound quality was 6 out of 5 stars.But then I noticed a firmware update in the Bose app. I foolishly thought that what was perfect could become even better. Wow, was I wrong. Shortly after the update, I noticed some random anomalies. For a split second, the sound would warp, almost as if the sync between the two buds skewed between stereo and mono. At first I thought it was just a random glitch in the source material but this proved not to be the case. The issue became more frequent and proved consistent on other devices with multiple sources. I officially had a defective product.Bose support was quick to exchange the earbuds for a new pair. They sent me a shipping label and were quick to ship on their end once they received my old set. I did not realize at the time that the new firmware was the issue. So when I got the new pair, guess what I did? Yep, updated the firmware right out of the box. Predictably, the same issue occurred with the new set. At this point I did what I should have the first time around and researched the issue online. It did not take long to find that many others were having the same problem since the update.The second call to Bose went similar to the first with a quick resolution to replace the headphones. I am now waiting for the new ones and hope they have an older firmware version on them. Unfortunately the Bose rep was not able to do anything but follow their script and had no information about if they were working on a fix for the firmware. i'm sure this is a known issue and hope that they address it soon.If Bose fixes their glitchy firmware then I will update this review and the buds will score a solid 5 stars.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2023",AEH2PBBYBNXC3VPPQAVR5LGXCNCA,True,5,Color: Triple Black
R2RIVNQN2LMOGH,B0B4PSQHD5,2.0 out of 5 stars One serious design flaw ruins what could've been excellent earbuds,MikenzCO,2,"I started out with bose over the ear headphones twenty years ago so i could sleep while a construction project next door. Those had great noise canceling for the time and good sound but most important the quality was there. Next i purchased the 1st gen wired earbuds. Those had better noise canceling and sound but i had to replace them under warranty because there was a problem with wires shorting out. Next i got the bose quietcomfort wireless noise canceling earbuds. Noise canceling was much improved as was sound quality. With those, that by the way i still have, never a single problem whatsoever. Quality took a turn for the better. Consequently i had similar expectations for these the quietcomfort earbuds II.The design was smaller as was the case. The latter was an improvement, much easier to open. Once i got the tips and sealer pieces in place i immediately noticed how much the sound had improved over the previous gen quietcomfort buds. Even better somehow they improved noise cancelation a great deal. Sounds, frequencies the others weren't able to do a good job blocking these did effortlessly. As to comfort they are still good in that respect but not so much as the previous gen buds. Then we get to the battery and charging.The newest iteration of buds when fully charged and with noise canceling active approximately an hour longer than the earlier version of wireless buds. That's where the good ends and a very serious flaw comes into play. More often than i go to use from what's supposed to be a fully charged case to hear them say not 100% but somewhere between 30-60%. Even with the case left plugged in with the buds inserted, it makes no difference. Then related they frequently won't disconnect from my devices unbeknownst to me based on outward appearances.So yet again bose quality takes the downward path. I want to love these earbuds but if they don't charge reliably what's the point of having them to begin with? I've searched online and found many customers experiencing the exact same issues. The few possible solutions didn't fix things at my end or the majority of those who posted online in help forums, reddit etc.All said i would not buy these again and have been disappointed too many times to remain a loyal bose customer. My next earbud purchase will not be from bose, I'm done giving them chances.","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2024",AFQM46NZOY7EQAQ3LRHHVQLOQJEA,True,1,Color: Soapstone

R21NMJKHZJR8AH,B0B4PSQHD5,"3.0 out of 5 stars They were okay, but not outstanding.",Kindle Customer,3,"I really really wanted to like these earbuds. I was upgrading from a less expensive noise-canceling pair because the noise-canceling on those was okay but not amazing. I tried to do my research because these aren't cheap, and I am a fan of Bose products.The pros: the sound on these was really good, and so was the noise-canceling. I liked that I could customize the controls for each earbud, to a point, and I liked how well it drowned out ambient noise when I activated the noise canceling. Even when I didn't have music playing, they would still muffle the sounds around me. The touch controls did take a minute to get used to, but it was nice to be able to control the volume from the earbuds, which is something I couldn't do on my old pair.Now the negatives.The connection problems that everyone talks about are valid. I only used these with my phone, and after a week they started to get weird with connecting to it. I tested the connection with one earbud, both earbuds and the problem seemed to be if I was consistently taking one in and out of the case. It's worth noting that the range on these if I walked away without my phone, was not very far.Another complaint I saw in the comments was the voice assistant that talks to you. I personally didn't have a problem because if you have any other product in the Bose family, namely the speakers, it's exactly the same with announcing the battery life and when you're connecting to a phone. The voice also doesn't come in too loud so that was not a concern for me.At the end of the day, the reason I returned them was because the earbuds were painful for me to wear. I tried every combination imaginable with the given interchangeable parts. None of them solved the problem and it just hurt too much to wear them for any extended period of time (an hour was about my limit). I do have small ears, so this is probably where the problem came from, but I tried the earbuds without the pieces that cover where the sound comes out (not sure what else to call it) and they were still too long.I get why they are priced so high, I do. I'm just disappointed that I spent that much money on something that ultimately didn't work. Definitely should've done more research on their comfort.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2023",AGBWPEUHYHJJEESSRTCYKLHB2RQA,True,4,Color: Soapstone

The only negative is that the case they are in is slippery. It keep slipping out of my hands, and when the case hits the floor, the top opens and the buds spill out.A textured case and a stronger spring on the flip cap. Otherwise very nice. I wear mine on the plane, mowing the lawn, and splitting wood with the splitter. It knocks the noise down substantially. Even blocks annoying conversations in a crowded room. Not bulky.Six month update:Still sound great. The little rubber band that surrounds the ear bud to make it easier to get out of the case easily falls off and gets lost.The buds need to be reseated in your ear every so often or they fall out, resulting in having to chase it across the floorMost annoying is they don’t seat very well in the charging case all the time. This results in staying connected to your phone and all calls going to it. It also discharges the earbuds so they are dead when you need them.Battery life is good. I wear them an hour every morning at the gym, and when doing other stuff aside from calls.Next time I’ll get ones that loop over the ear so I don’t have to run after them when they fall out.","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2023",AHZHF4RU6YWJORWRM3O23IVYRVKQ,True,1,Color: Triple Black

Below I will list the Pros and Cons as to why I still decided to return the second pair.Pros:- Incredible sound. You pick up sounds and quality in songs you've never even noticed before. Whole new experience.- Touch controls are seamless and make it very easy for controlling.- Noice cancellation is the best Ive experienced for any earbuds I have ever tried.- Snug fit so if you want to use for running or sports.Cons:- Not as compatible with apple products as traditional airpods. You have to use physical controls to activate Siri and noise cancellation. Cant be done by voice.- Starts to hurt ears after 30+ minutes of use due to how snug they fit. Earhooks on bose soundsports are much better.- Bigger charging case than most earbuds that dont show battery life without having to access app and no wireless charging. Must use USB-C for charging.- You can only create one shortcut per earbud with long press.-Noise cancellation is only to block out sounds you can hear but does not cancel out background noises to listeners for phone calls.

R3M1JT3H3RS0E9,B0B4PSQHD5,4.0 out of 5 stars Hypercosis sufferers rejoice,Cal Sand,4,I purchased these with hopes of better managing my severe hypercosis. That means very normal sounds are quite painful to my ears.The sound canceling on these earbuds is shockingly good. Shockingly good. You could be sitting right by a fan and that noise is going to disappear completely.I can use earplugs in the real world but then I can't really hear what people are saying. These earbuds work as they should they cancel a lot of outside noise while still allowing you to speak and hear within an acceptable range. That is life-changing for me.The app is frustrating to use so far. These things demand to be paired even though they don't need to be paired to anything in order to work with the sound canceling. So I have to pair them to the app and then mute the app in order to use them like they would if no app existed. And it's not even the app that the earbuds themselves demand to be paired to a device. I don't want that but I haven't yet found a work around. Because if I don't have Wi-Fi or I'm not in an area where they can be paired then they just constantly bark to be paired. It's very unnecessary and very annoying. It's possible that I will find Solutions as these are quite new to me.I don't know what the sound quality is like in frankly I don't care. These are strictly sound muting devices for me and for that purpose they seem to be very effective.

R2P6U1KYIBGY18,B0B4PSQHD5,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Earbuds I Have Ever Found,Nate,5,"Let me tell you the saga of my earbud journey.I have very small ears and have never found a pair of earbuds that fits comfortably, stays in, and doesn't cause me any pain. I had a pair of UE fits, because those buds were the only ones I've found that were mildly comfortable (but they still fell out and felt too large) so when UE came out with their custom built ""Drops"" earbuds, I ecstatically tried them. To my great disappointment, they could not size my ears and told me that their custom buds would never work for me.That made me give up all hope that I would be able to find comfortable earbuds, but I was determined to find some that at least didn't fall out like my UE fits, and were higher quality (since the UE fits feel sort of flimsy and cheap, really) and after much research I decided to try these, but my expectations were low. I did not expect them to work.Boy, have I never been so wrong in my life! These are amazing!!! They are extremely comfortable - absolutely no pain. I can fall asleep with them in my ears and they are still there when I wake up. The sound quality and noise cancellation is better than any other headphone or earbuds I have ever tried. They feel durable and high-quality - they work like a charm. I am absolutely in love. I never want to take them out of my ears because they give me such peaceful quiet, but are comfortable enough that I forget they are even there.I do wish they had multipoint as I tend to use two devices at once fairly frequently, but I am hopeful that they will come out with an update about that sometime in the future. Wireless charging would also be nice, but it's totally not a requirement.Other than that, I have absolutely no complaints. It's also worth noting that they seem well-protected in their case. The magnets are good and, unlike my UE fits that drop out of my case super easily, these have strong magnets that keep them well in place so I feel more comfortable taking them places.If you have small ears, I'd definitely recommend trying these. They are the best ones I have ever found and I have tried A LOT of earbuds, including custom-made ones, that did not work at all. These have so many different configurations you can alter and shift, which means they really do have a size for everyone. Plus, they are high quality with almost all of the modern-day features you would expect them to have.TL;DR:As someone with weird ears that don't even work with custom earbuds, these are perfect. I never want to take them off.","Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2023",AF4YRZRQDMQ45N7DZRVEE4PN5RQA,True,24,Color: Soapstone

The sound quality is superb. The fit is extrodinary. The battery life is amazing. The noice cancelation is unbeliveable. The problem? Getting them to stay connected. I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max, an MSI WS-75 Workstaion Laptop and an HP Envy laptop that I have the Bose QC Earbuds 2 connected to. I followed all of the instructions, yet in my office, the earbuds will stay connected to my iPhone for just shy of 2 minutes. I reconnected them 8 times before I switched to the MSI laptop - and that wasn't much better. I have resynched them several times, I have cycled the power on the phone repeatedly...in other words I have done everything that I have read to do (and the Bose website is not much help). I am going to try for another week before I send them back. (I am currently on my front porch with Walter the cat, and they have now stayed connected to the iPhone for about 8 minutes).

One week exactly and I have intiated a return from Amazon - they are so annoying I could not use them any longer. When you start looking for answers on line about the connection issue (the only issueI had with them) you find that this is very very common, and the only work around that Bose has is ""resync them"", and they want to blame ""interferance"".

R219EN7R2SXA8B,B0B4PSQHD5,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Audio, Great Fit, Features/Connectivity Need Improvement",UnderWaterSuperHero,4,"I purchased these primarily because I’ve owned and have loved everything about my experience with the Bose QC35II Headphones. Also, the reviews about the audio quality from those who have used competing brands and especially from those who have compared the BOSE earbuds to the BOSE headphones made me relatively certain that I would be satisfied with the audio quality of these earbuds.The connectivity features of the BOSE earbuds however, are lacking. Things that you think should work intuitively, don’t always. For example, the earbuds don’t automatically connect to the last source they were connected to when you put them away, and there is no way to select a different (paired) source using the touch-sensitive controls on the earbuds. Instead, you have to go to your TV or PC or phone’s Bluetooth settings to connect the earbuds, and that isn’t always as reliable as you would expect. I don’t like having to rely on using an app or placing the earbuds in the case to switch sources.A glaring omission with the app is that while it does provide charge level indications for each earbud, WHY is there NO CHARGE LEVEL INDICATION FOR THE CASE?!?!?! It’s very annoying to place your discharged earbuds in the case for an hour, thinking they will be fully charged, only to remove them from the case and discover that you only have less than a full charge, sometimes far less than a full charge, because the case ran out of power. There is no way of knowing how much charge remains in the case. I hope that BOSE updates the app to add an indicator for case charge level, if the case hardware even supports doing that . . . It may not even be possible, and that would be an even greater disappointment.All things considered, I am very happy with the BOSE QC Earbuds II. They sound amazing, fit well, deliver best-in-class noise reduction, provide a decent feature set and are, ultimately, worth the high price of admission as long as they provide me with this level of enjoyment for at least as many years as my Bose QC35 II headphones have done.","Reviewed in the United States April 28, 2023",AEGYRW3XXD6H72DOXGGDPYZXQMOA,True,24,Color: Triple Black

RK67DLRU7J478,B0B4PSQHD5,5.0 out of 5 stars AMAZING ear buds,Caroline,5,"The other day right before a business trip I managed to lose one of my Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro, and was ready to order a replacement pair. As far as I knew, they were great - except that I could never get the fit quiet right, no matter what replacement size (and brand) tips I tried. Which means that a yawn or sometime talking was enough for one to fall out, and when I went on runs, it was always a little iffy.Being a Bose fan, I decided to try these out. I own the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, which were a must on long flights as the above mentioned buds did not cancel the noise quiet as much as I would like, which I attributed to being a bud. I was hesitant as I have had some connection issues with bose (when it connects to two devices), but in the end I opted for these.Hands down, these are the best purchase ever. Out of the box, the fit was great. I can yawn, shake my head, run, etc. and both buds feel secure. Even better, I barely notice that they are there.The noise cancelling is the best I have ever experienced - better than my now three year old Bose 700 over the hear headphones. On the plane, a simple touch goes from ""aware"" when Im ordering a drink"" to ""noise cancellation"" which is outstanding - even the PA annnouncements are severely muffled and very low decible. While I have not played with creating new modes, know that you can if you have particular needs for environments.The touch controls are intuitive and easy to use - somehow I find it easier than with the Samsung buds and Bose over ear headphones, but maybe I am just bias and excited with these new ones.And the sound quality? Also amazing. I'm no expert on this front, but I can say it is superior to both my over the ear Bose (which to me were the gold standard), misc. bluetooth speakers I have, and the samsung buds. I cannot describe it.As for connectivity issues - so far all is good, though I am not sure I know all the details yet (like if they can connect to two devices and the auto connection).One thing that made me hesitate was how waterproof they are, but in the end, I realized at most they would experience rain, maybe a quick drop in the snow (not likely as I'd have a hat or headband on), and sweat. These are rated for those kinds of water interactions. I've never droped headphones or earbuds in water or needed them to survive being submerged, and I do not see that changing, so I am not worried.Overall, I would say they are worth the increased price over others.","Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2022",AEA5FQSSECS7OSGHZJC7F2IA3QTA,True,23,Color: Triple Black
RYQL05GYTJGOA,B0B4PSQHD5,3.0 out of 5 stars Connectivity issues hampered otherwise great performance,Pelin C.,3,"These earbuds sound great, and the noise cancellation technology is very impressive. Even if I do not have any sound playing at the moment, I found it difficult to even have a conversation with someone while wearing the earbuds with quiet mode enabled. The battery life was great, and I also was able to get a great fit in my ears through trial and error with the various included sizes (historically I have had trouble with other brand earbuds staying in place).With all of that said, I had two different poor experiences with these buds. First, every now and then the audio would have some weird quirk where the sound had an echo (for lack of a better word) and sounded off. It typically just lasted a few seconds, and would happen randomly. That bug was annoying, though if that were the only issue I would have likely ignored it. My much more significant bad experience with these earbuds involves connectivity issues. I used these with two different devices, and switch back and forth between devices was pretty simple. After a few weeks, however, my earbuds would randomly completely stop working with either one or both of the devices, and I would have to re-connect and pair them with the device again. The connectivity issue kept getting worse over time, where I had to attempt multiple restarts and pairings to get them to work again, and it got to the point where it would lose that connection after just a few days. This was too much for me, so I ultimately returned them.In summary, to the extent my earbuds were not uniquely defective, if these bugs are worked out, the earbuds are otherwise an excellent choice.","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2024",AE73FZEIPS6Y3LBT6VP6WW62ANMA,True,0,Color: Soapstone

Additionally, they don't stay in the ears while sleeping. So, I've resorted to having to wear these with Pandora music playing while also wearing a pair of over-the-ear noise-canceling headphones to try to drown out the noise.

R8NU3MYIG5WT,B0B4PSQHD5,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect For Small Ears,Amazon Customer,5,"I am a grown woman with ears the size of a five year old. Most ear buds are too big, hurt my ears, and pop out when I move my jaw (in other words, that means singing is out of the question). I did a LOT of research, reading as many articles as I could on this very specific subject. I decided to go for broke and try these first. When I first pulled them out of their case, I was skeptical of the size. I was sure I was going to pop them out of my ears, as usual, and they'd break on the floor. So I sat in the middle of my bed, followed the instructions to the letter, and gave them a shot. First I moved my jaw aggressively in every possible direction. They stayed put. Then I jerked my head from side to side and they remained in place. Then I got up and jumped on the bed and they never budged. Only then did I decide to try them out around the house. I've had them for a couple of months now and have had zero issues with them. They are comfortable and stay in place. Just be sure to follow the instructions to put them in properly. And, yes, the sound quality is phenomenal - as to be expected from Bose. Thank you for making ear buds that are comfortable and stay put in my tiny ears!","Reviewed in the United States March 23, 2024",AGKX3QWH6TSERDPYVFPPTUWVTFVQ,True,0,Color: Eclipse Grey

They are more comfortable to wear than the first-gen Bose QC, and the performance is better. The sound quality and noise cancellation are absolutely fantastic and better than the QC I. I had some issues with pairing the QC I buds with devices that could not install the app, but these pair fine, app or not. Range from the source seems slightly better, as well.The app is pretty good if limited in function. I very much appreciate the ability to select another source in the app (even if I need to connect it to the device I am using first). Occasionally, the app is not able to find the earbuds if I open the app before I take an earbud out of the case, but that's easily fixed. My biggest complaint about functions is that you have only 2 options when it comes to a shortcut (either changing the ""mode"" or activating the voice assistant--pretty lame--I'd like to see more options there.The microphone has very good fidelity, but it picks up every single little breeze. That makes it, at least, very irritating when trying to talk to someone on the phone while outside, and it can even be nearly impossible. That really needs to be fixed.I've yet to run the battery dry, so I cannot comment on battery life. However, it seems to be at least as good as advertised if you can trust it's own assessment of how much charge remains.But that brings us to the only real, glaring disadvantage over the QC I. The QC II case does not have wireless charging. I don't know what's going on with that or who thought that was a good idea. Every other friggin' ""premium"" earbuds I've seen in the last five years (or more) have wireless charging. I know it's already a large case, but I think we'd all be fine with one slightly larger enough to accomodate wireless charging.","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2023",AFEPXW5KNJGJPICKNCJAPK636M7A,True,10,Color: Triple Black

This is the reason I got them to begin with. I’m stopping the praise there because I don’t think ear buds should be praised for staying in ones ear.The mic in these are also better for phone calls in the outdoors (I’m told by people I’m talking to) as they do better at blocking wind from overtaking the mic and muting your voice.HOWEVER, the positives end there. The connectivity of these to my iPhone, iPad or basically any electronic device I’ve used them with is laughably bad. I mean, truly, comically terrible at staying connected to your device while playing your music or podcast or audiobook. I have yet to go a single session without the program I’m listening to cutting out, sounding robotic, or having the two ear buds being out of sync. Yes, I always start by putting the right one in my ear first and waiting for the ding-dong and battery level verification before putting in the left earbud (which, how dumb is that). I still, without fail, have many interruptions through my workout or conversations due to some type of connectivity issue.The sound, if they connect, is what you’d expect from Bose headphones, right up until the point you hear static or out of sync earbuds that sound like your listening to wired headphones with an exposed wire.Lastly, they are huge. The case is huge and if you have a case protector to protect your $250 pair of ear buds, they are way too big to comfortably keep in your pocket. I have to clip them to my work bag so I don’t have a second bulge sticking out of my pants.I’m super disappointed in these earbuds but am past my return date so my only choice is to make sure I do my part in preventing someone else from making the same mistake.","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2024",AFOQ4HXVW3IJRIPDVFQTGAMDGM7Q,True,0,Color: Triple Black
R1WD9G5D7V08GV,B0B4PSQHD5,"3.0 out of 5 stars I like them more than airpods, except they are very delicate.",Loki,3,"Short review:An upgrade in every way to their previous earbuds. Better noise cancellation, better charging case, at least as good of fit (it feels just as secure as the last ones in my ears). Useable for long periods of time without discomfort (the previous ones would hurt my ear after awhile), I have used these from full to zero twice now without any notable discomfort. The sound is at least on par with the previous version, my brain says it's better but my mind says it's about the same. Overall I like them better than airpods, but I would not recommend these over airpods for another reason; see below.My experience with these Bose earbuds:At first, quite happy; used them with no issues for several weeks. The case slips my hand and falls to the floor one day, and one earbud stops working as a result; returned the unit and got a replacement, no fuss; props to Bose there.Second unit goes same as the first, I use it for a few weeks but then instead of dropping the whole case, I drop one earbud while sitting in a car. The earbud did not break entirely, but now it has a persistent scratching noise that happens about a minute after it powers on. Tried various different fixes, nothing worked; I have now sent that one in for replacement as of writing.Assuming they send me a third unit, I will apparently need to be supremely careful in my handling of these extremely delicate earbuds. Between the second unit breaking and me returning it for replacement, I waited a couple months, instead using some apple Airpods daily. Like I mentioned above, I like the Bose earbuds better in a vacuum. Comes down to personal preference; they are not really much better than each other in any aspect other than durability. Over the course of two months using the airpods daily, I have dropped the entire case two or three times and individual buds once or twice. No breaking, no malfunctioning, no visible damage. This is especially strange considering I had Bose's previous QC earbuds, the first version; I still do have them, and they have been subjected to way more abuse than these newer QC buds and the Airpods combined and still function just fine. Something about the new design, while better than the first design, just isn't durable enough for day to day use. I would recommend the apple Airpods instead.","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2023",AGXD6HDZDA4OZRL7KSVGTMFYN7CA,True,54,Color: Triple Black
R1TDGGSZRMJQLV,B0B4PSQHD5,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, but some issues",Alexis Aquino,3,"TLDR: great sound, but there are issues that shouldn't occur at this price point.The noise canceling is great, but it's biggest weakness is wind. If you are trying to use it outside, you will hear the wind if there is anything stronger than a breeze (even at its highest noise canceling setting). Because of that, it works great indoors, but is less than ideal outdoors. I have also had issues occur where both the ear buds would connect, but only one will play audio. For me, it's usually the right bud that connects but doesn't play audio. When this happens, the right bud can still be used to pause and skip, but no sound comes out. Additionally, noise canceling does not work will this occurs since both buds need to putput audio. Meaning that this not uncommon problem takes away the biggest selling point of these earbuds. The easiest solution I've found to this is to place the buds in the case and charge the case (just placing the buds in and closing the case has not consistently worked). While this is an easy enough fix, it is not a problem I expected to have at this price point. Furthermore, if you are on the go, you may not have a charger on you and will have to wait for access to it.","Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2024",AENY7MROWUYFVI7UEHYN4FCZ6MJQ,True,1,Color: Triple Black

I ultimately went with Bose due to their recognized reputation. While I am overall happy with them, there are some negatives I'd like to share. First, they are a bit difficult to remove from the charging case. I have taken to ""flicking"" them to get them to come out. Similarly, i use them to watch movies occasionally while in bed. They are a bit difficult to seat properly in the case without shinning a light on them - kind of undermines my reason for using them to watch something to subsequently fall asleep to. The lack of Qi or wireless charging is also a bit of a detraction. For earbuds in this price range, that should be a standard in this day and age.I sought out active noise cancellation as I travel frequently. I have not yet had the opportunity to try the active cancellation on a plane as of yet.The app or software that governs the ""modes"" and what not, should, IMHO, have more than the currently 4-preset noise cancellation modes, and, though it may be available, I haven't found it yet, the software / app for a laptop or desktop.Overall, they aren't bad, with the additions of the items mentioned above though, they could become exceptional.","Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2023",AH6UCD5BOGGLDZCZ4X7YXRRXC36Q,True,9,Color: Triple Black

R3HI6YRRFWOLZH,B0B4PSQHD5,"5.0 out of 5 stars Best in Class Noice Cancelling, Very Good Audio, and Fit Options, Poor Connect Application",Charles M.,5,"I decided on the QC2 after trying Galaxy Buds2 Pro, Sony Wf-1000xm4, and Audio Technica ATH-TWX9. The Audio Technica have a better sound signature (for my liking) and have the look and feel of a $300 earbud. The mid and highs have a brilliance that the others I tried don't. However, I could only get them to seal using aftermarket tips that were uncomfortable and the noise cancelling was mid-tier at best. The Bose had Alternate Tips and stability bands, XXS and XL, on their website and I needed the XL. They fit perfectly and are very comfortable. Other manufacturers should take note. Another no brainer for a flagship Earbud would be wireless charging, which Bose does not support. Not a deal breaker for me but another miss.The Bose connect App is, frankly, not good. The Apps for all of the Buds I tried were better and THEY STAYED CONNECTED. The QC2 box states ""Made for iPhone, Works with Android"". I would assume that the App problems might be better with iPhone but is very frustrating using my S22 Ultra. I have to connect to it numerous times throughout the day and at least once a week I have to re-pair the Buds to my phone as the App can't find the device although it is actually paired to the phone. I would also like at least a 5-band equalizer in place of the 3-band.Another shortcoming is Codec support. While the QC2 supports SBC and AAC it lacks any type of APTX or the higher resolution LDAC. Hopefully this will be corrected in an upcoming firmware update.Bottom Line for me is I can for a while tolerate the poor App because the really good Noise Cancelling, very good audio quality and a really great fit. If we can get APTX HD or Lossless and invest some money into the Connect App these will be hard to top.UPDATE: I have been using these steadily for 3 weeks now and must say I'm quite impressed. After tweaking using The Equalizer the sound is excellent. I can wear these for hours and actually forget I have them in. The noise canceling is world class. I've learned to live with the app although I do wish it would stay connected, but definitely not a deal breaker.

I had the wired earbuds for years and they were fantastic- and finally wore out after daily use for years. So, enter these. They drop calls like crazy, people can't hear me, and they randomly connect to things in the case or out. The noise cancelling is never fully ""off"" (which I knew ahead of time but didn't think would be a problem). My biggest issue is that I bought them to seamlessly go between listening to music or my computer (pairing to two sources) and taking phone calls. These don't work for any of it. It has been an incredibly frustrating experience and, because I bought them on amazon, Bose won't refund me (understandable but wish I would have known that when I bought them). Bose sent me the Quiet Comfort Ultra and it has the exact same problems. Incredibly frustrating that my clients can't hear me (""you keep dropping out"") and in the middle of watching a movie while flying (or listening to music at my office), each pair (of 4) has just stopped working. Randomly. I'm not doing anything different. It just says ""iphone lost."" Absolutely not worth the money and they don't do what they are touted to do. I just want other to know these are not great. I've done all the resets, deleted the Bose app (because it was allegedly the problem), etc. Been on the phone with tech support multiple times for each pair. Nothing works. They just suck. And because I bought them here, can't get a refund, but can get a replacement of the same poor product. When they work, the sound is pretty good. The calls never sound great, though.

That said, the wired version of the QC I've been using with my iPhone for several years fits in my ears tighter and gives me better noise cancellation. The wired version uses stability bands that extrude from the earbuds, keeping them more securely in place, and the ear tip material is a little stiffer which, for me, works better.This all apparently differs between individuals, so they may work well for you, as they seem to have done for others. It's just the comparison falls a bit short for me. The charging case is nice, battery life is okay for me, and the quality overall seems excellent. The wired version cost nearly as much as these several years ago, so the price for these is okay in my opinion.I use mine mostly at home while exercising on my elytical machine.

The Sony's sounded fantastic and the noise cancelling was great. But the battery life of the earbud is unacceptable. I tried several things I saw in the web but the battery life on the right earbud won't go more than an hour.I first bought the AirPods Pro 2 because I operate in the apple ecosphere. I tried for a few days but ended up returning it because the ANC is no where good as the Sony. I work out of a Starbucks an hour or two everyday and the AirPods were letting in way too much noise.So, I am now trying out the Bose. Here are a few observations:- The ANC is fantastic...perhaps even better than the Sonys. I haven't done a side by side test at Starbucks but the ANC blocks out an amazing amount of external noise.- The sound is not on par with the Sony. The XM-4 has a cleaner and crisper sound- I get close to six hours on the earbuds with ANC on. I can't speak to the longevity of the batteries as I've only had these for a few weeks.- Comfort and fit is excellent.Overall, I am very pleased thus far. The best trait - ANC. I just hope the batteries will be better than the Sonys.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2023",AH55B3L3CXPHJXOUDUKRRXUBXX7Q,True,12,Color: Triple Black

I was a little suspect about earphones but my goodness they are incredibly effective. The comfort from being able ot pick between earbud and stability band sizes is a huge gamechanger - normally I just accept that earphones will hang loosely in my ears, but these can accomplish a secure and very comfortable fit.Pros: sound is great, and you can fiddle around with the balance in the Bose app (I increase the mid and trebles from the default). Comfort as mentioned before is incredible, although I have yet to have worn them any longer than ~2 hours. Battery as far as I can tell is more than good enough for my usage (listening to music and audible books during my commute, so about ~3 hours a day).My first criticism, is the case hinge feels pretty weak. I don't remember if it started that way, or just having it in my pocket for a few days has soften the case joint, but it feels like the build quality of the case is a little shy of what you'd hope for at this price point.My second criticism is the noise canceling, when put into ""Aware"" mode, seems to rely on having multiple sound levels to distinguish background noise from other noise. Background chatter is only made quieter if someone is talking to me, and then gets louder when the conversation ends, which results in the background noise oscillating in volume. Also loud sounds (like a train horning its arrival) seem to screw around with it a bit.My third criticism is that the left earbud seems reasonably prone to dropping the connection. I've had it for about a month, and about 3-4 times I've needed to put both earbuds in to redo the pairing. It seems most prone to doing this if I take one earbud out to better hear the surrounding world, where when I put that earbud back in it struggles to pair it again.","Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2022",AGMTN3JKWCH6TJAOWC2OMCQNZEFQ,True,34,Color: Triple Black

I can tell you right now the fit is way better and the noise-cancelling as well. I feel the sound quality in the Sony XM5's is better but not by much so I'm happy with the Bose.

One of those earbuds finally stopped working so I figured I'd give the new ones a go. I've had them for a little over a week now and they are a downgrade in every single aspect other than their form factor and comfort. Instead of giving you my life story, I'll give you what ya want.The connection issues are very real, these things are a nightmare to connect to anything. If you're often swapping devices with them, you're going to have a constant bottleneck in your life which will be getting these headphones to connect to anything. Then after you've finally gotten both earbuds to connect, they will randomly disconnect, for no apparent reason, from time to time too. One last thing about their connection issues: when I was connected to my PC with my old ones, if I had to go to the opposite side of the house or something - yeah they'd disconnect, but when I came back to my PC they'd reconnect seamlessly and it just worked. These not only do not reconnect, they never properly disconnect when out of range so you can't just reconnect them. You have to put them back in the case, mess around with your PC's Bluetooth settings until it says they're disconnected, then you have to go through the tedious process of getting them to connect again. It sucks.Now on to the case, it's trash. Yeah, it's slightly smaller than the other one but it lost wireless charging, doesn't have a latch like the old one, and it is not sturdy at all. It's the case for a $300 pair of earbuds and you could easily snap the lid off of it while putting it in your pocket because it's so flimsy. The headphones have almost non-existent magnets that hold them in the case and there is no latch or magnet for the lid at all. Thus, if you drop this case there is no chance the earbuds will remain in the case. I honestly can't believe Bose released this low-quality product as their ""flagship"" earbuds.Sound Quality - the same as the old model except if you hear something high pitch it will overload the speaker and make a very ""shrill"" noise in your ear that hurts. Overall, the sound quality has gotten worse from the last pair.Noise cancellation - is the same as the last pair, if not a little better because the overall shape, design, and fit of the new earbuds are much better than the first model.A niche issue but actually is the dealbreaker for me and is the reason I'm here giving a detailed bad review: There is not anywhere in the settings to turn the touch buttons off on the earbuds. I often go on long runs outside and once I start sweating, buttons start getting pressed by my sweat. This constantly disrupts my audiobook and my run flow. Now, these headphones are going back and I'll just buy a new pair of the first model QC Earbuds.

I have a couple broken nails on my right hand, and it was still difficult. I loosened one enough from the case to get it, but it’s also slippery and landed in the corner of my couch. I was able to grab it before it fell to the bottom, but please beware. I’m not sure yet what I’m going to do. I’ve never bought anything like these and I’m hesitant to keep if they will get lost before I have a real chance to use them.","Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2024",AETOAX3OSMR42TQLASETSTTWCS7Q,True,1,Color: Triple Black
R2Q504KNU5OTGQ,B0B4PSQHD5,5.0 out of 5 stars Great If You Have Annoying Neighbors,andyyv1,5,"This is the first pair of noise-cancelling earbuds I've owned and these exceeded my expectations. I have Bose over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones too, but they tend to hurt my ears despite replacing the pads. So far, the earbuds do not hurt my ears and work better than earplugs if you're trying to get rid of the bass-sounds around you; I have noisy neighbors, kids running around next to me in the apartment I live in and these get rid of their annoying sounds. Battery life is great - I don't have to plug them into the wall but maybe once a week. I can also sleep on my back with these in. Sleeping on my side is a little more tricky since you can't have your ears directly on your pillow but I do use them sometimes just to help me get to sleep - they work better than the QuietOn earplugs I have for noise cancellation and they don't hurt the insides of my ears like all earplugs eventually do. Also, I do not have the mobile app for this, but for my purposes, I don't need it; It does what I want it to do as far as noise cancellation which is the primary reason I got these. Music doesn't sound bad - it's a little bassy but I cant readjust eq in the program (mostly Spotify). These are a real life-saver if you need more quiet in your life.","Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2024",AHJXIYV57HUYM5CYZQZ6CTXWG63Q,True,11,Color: Triple Black
R2XQBH78WNO233,B0B4PSQHD5,3.0 out of 5 stars Worst out of box experience ever do not recommend,Philip K.,3,"First of all, if you want a buds that work right outside the box, this IS NOT the buds. I tried several times to get these to connect to my phone, and even then it keeps disconnecting from my phone. This is my first impression right out of the box.I currently use Samsung buds 2 pro, Sony XM4 and bose QC earbuds first generation. I have not had any issues with any of these above, except for this one. I thought to take a chance with the connection issue, but I was wrong. Right now, it doesn't detect my left buds, it fails when I do fit check testing, it won't connect to iPhone 14 pro obviously, and if the current SW update doesn't fix it, this is going right back. Not worth $279, let alone $200.I wouldn't take these for free, the worst experience I've ever had with Bose. I've used bose since their first quiet comfort headsets, including NC700. How can bose mess up this bad is beyond me, but this product has to be the biggest failure in history of their products.Update: Nov 10FW update made it somewhat usable but now volume control doesn't work on both left and right buds. So, I figure either it is really FW issue or I have a lemon. I feel like I'm a beta tester for their product. At this point, this product is only worth $100 because of its ANC performance, other than that everything else is subpar at this point.","Reviewed in the United States November 9, 2023",AEAZRQPF73PC7YX33VJWFXNBCREQ,True,1,Color: Eclipse Grey

There are, however, major connectivity problems with this product. They will pair reliably a majority of the time, but far too often they will fail to connect, or only one of them will connect, or they will take a dump mid-use and stop working altogether. About once a month they will fully fail to pair and you have to set them up all over again like they were new. They also lose connection and then regain it about a half second later--first one side, then the other--and this happens sometimes every few minutes during use. If they could debug the wireless problems, it would actually be a nice product.","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2024",AHQI6TMXRF627X4IEAH7OFFYIK2Q,True,1,Color: Triple Black

I bought the Bose Soundsport used a few years back and they were good but bulky sticking out of my ear and no noise cancellation. I've tried airpods and hated them due to connectivity and how awkward they felt in my ear. I finally broke down and sold all those and bought the Bose quiet comfort and I'm very happy with them! They came in 60% charged which was great cause i wanted to try them out immediately. Simple set up with the software and connectivity and once that was done i put them on and they fit very well.I run a fan and an air cleaner in my room since I live in the middle of the city, so my room is usually noisy; once i put on the headphones it took a minute, but the sound cancellation kicked in without me realizing it was a default setting. For a moment i thought we lost power to the rooms cause the noise from the fans just gradually vanished! The sound comes in crystal clear, and the noise cancellation makes it feel like you're listening to music in a soundproof room. I've only had them for a day so i'm looking forward to working out with them, doing calls and listening to music on the go. I'll glady update after a few more weeks with trying them out but for now i'm super happy with my buy!UPDATE: 1/14/2024Couldn't be happier with my headphones!! I game them a real test and work out with them at the gym to see how well they held up. When the noise gets too much to where i can't focus, i kick on noise cancel and the whole gym goes dead silent!

R7DFF4ME3W0NW,B0B4PSQHD5,4.0 out of 5 stars Feels like a downgrade,Michael,4,The noise cancellation is cool but you can't turn it off there's just a digital pass through so hope your never unwrapping cellophane (unlikely but excruciating) with these on but it makes all external sound seem a little weird. The left one never works on it's own (I'm told there is a fix for this). Compared to my soundsports the sound is cleaner but that seems like a side effect of the noise cancellation because music doesn't as good. Then they don't do dual channel and will only connect to one device. They fit really nicely but seems like the tech is going in the wrong direction.

Completely blocks fan hum noise, most of TV sound and conversations. Taking out one earbud pauses media play and disables noise cancellation. Once re-inserted, the media starts playing and noise cancellation activates. This is very helpful when you need to talk to someone briefly. Comparison: Bose QuietComfort 2 95% noise reduction Samsung Buds 2 40% Jabra Evolve 75 30% I can wear the Bose QC 2 for >2 hours easily and sleep with them. They don't fall out. Samsung Buds 2 get loose and easily fall out after moving my jaw too much. Ridiculous. I can't wear any over the ear headset comfortably for more than 20 minutes.Bad:In-ear detection is problematic.I finally learned that, when inserting, I have to firmly press and hold the bud into the ear for 2 sec before letting go for the ear detection to work. Once the bud activates in the ear, there are no further issues.Before I learned how to do that I resorted to a complete reset which requires many steps and time.No tracking for the buds or the case.No indication of how much charge the case has.Cannot automatically switch between two devices.Manual switch is problematic. It may require shutting off the bluetooth on the device you are trying to disconnect from.No wireless charging. Really? It is 2023.Occasionally the app can take 10 sec to connect.I had to exchange original order because the buds could no longer connect to the phone app.Good thing it is simple to replace with Amazon if the problem happens early on.Bose must improve it software and quality control.You may feel slight ear pressure from noise cancellation. Mind you that ear plugs are 10 times more uncomfortable. People with very good hearing may hear slight white background noise when surroundings are completely quiet. This doesn't seem to bother anyone much.Price is steep but if you pay half as much, you will get a quarter of the noise cancellation quality.There is much to improve. Would I buy it again?

R30K9A3PAAN7RQ,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars Is it worth $300?,Atlas,5,"For the last 3 months, I wanted to find a pair of wireless earbuds that were, at the very least, comfortable.My previous pair of wireless earbuds, Sony's WFSP800N were, by far, the most comfortable wireless earbuds I have ever experienced. That being said, they're going on four years old. They disconnected randomly from my phone, they often remained on when I put them in their charging case, and on a few occasions, just my sweat would be enough to trigger the touch sensors and either skip or pause whatever song I was listening to.So, I set out to try just about every major brand that *wasn't* Sony this time around.I tried the top of the line in the $200 price range from Jabra, Beats, and Sennheiser.Jabra was by far the one I wanted to succeed the most. I picked up the Jabra Elite 8. The sound was good. Noise cancelling was automatic and easy to cycle. And the fact that the materials were military grade and built to withstand just about anything really sold me. Unfortunately, prolonged wear hurt my right ear. I returned them a few days later and tried the Beats Fit Pro. I thought that the wings would provide stabilization and comfort. I was wrong. I didn't even get a chance to really try them out. My ears were in agonizing pain due to the rigidity of the wings. I returned them the same day I bought them. I had high hopes for Sennheiser, and though they sounded amazing, they hurt in the same way that Jabra did.Cue Bose to come in. The thing that set them apart from the competition were the comfort wings. They come in three different sizes. I tried using the medium wings first, but prolonged use still caused pain in just my right ear, even though my left was fine. The small wings though fit perfectly in both, and have not created any issues of discomfort or pain. They're actually on par comfort wise with the Sony earbuds I got almost 4 years ago.Now, the sound was night and day to anything I have ever tried before. The sheer depth of everything was immaculate, and with the app you can adjust the different tones accordingly. But the features that won out was the noise cancelling ""quiet"" mode, the sound heightening ""immersion"" mode, and the all around ""aware"" mode.These are the best noise cancelling earbuds I have ever experienced with the quiet mode. The immersion mode let's you listen to music in all levels around you as if you're sitting in the middle of an orchestra. The aware mode transfers sound from the outside to you as if you aren't wearing headphones at all.All three modes are miles above the other competing products I have bought. But the Aware mode is absolutely amazing as any other version of this sounds Tinny or Electronic. This was the first time I have ever forgotten I was even wearing headphones. The music may not have been playing, but the background noise was so clear that I just didn't need to take the headphones out and put them away. This actually made it easy to listen to music at a low volume and still be able to keep up with concentrating on conversations or work place activities and lectures.The case uses the USB C charging cable, and you get a full charge if it's completely dead in about 2 hours. That being said, I probably get about 6 to 8 hours with consecutive use of the earbuds on a single charge. With the charging case, I can probably go 20 to 25 hours without needing to recharge. But what I love is that not only will the earbuds audibly tell you when they are low after they've been sitting in the case, the case itself has a light indicator to tell you when the charging battery is drained.Overall, is this worth $300? Considering it blew every other $200 competitor, including my original earbuds out of the water (which I paid $250 for when they were released near 4 years ago), I would say that TO ME, they are worth the money. I'm not comparing them to current Sonys on the market, nor have I ever tried the Quiet Comfort 2s. If you feel that it isn't big enough of a jump, then cool. But to me, comparing them to all of the earbuds that caused me pain, I do feel like this is a case of ""Getting Your Money's Worth.""I sincerely like these, and I am happy I spent the money for the sake of impressive comfort and impressive sound quality.11/14/2023","Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2023",AE4HOCB4MLK73PCYWVSSYFTA7C6Q,True,764,Color: Black
R2E8UX3FB8SWNE,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars Superb Eabuds,Jacobson,5,"I rarely write reviews, due to lack of time and the fact that if a product performs the way it's supposed to, it doesn't deserve my time to review it. For the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, I will make an exception.Simply put, they are wonderful - the sound, the noise cancelling, the ease of fit and comfort. A solid product all around. I have never been a big Bose fan. I thought their products were good, but not great and overpriced. I was looking for a pair of earbuds to replace my old faithful Jabra 65T Elites that finally died. They were nearly 4 years old and didn't owe me anything. Based on reviews, I tried the Apple AirPod Pro 2nd gen, the Sony WF-1000XM5 and the Bose.I was interested in the AirPods mostly because of their compatibility with my Iphone and my son's recommendation. I returned them for three reasons. First, to get them to fit with a tight seal was an ordeal. Fifteen minutes of futzing around to finally pass the seal test (and that's with Comply foam tips -- the Apple silicone tips didn't work for me period.) And even after passing the seal test, I did not find the ANC particularly effective. Adjusting the volume by sliding my finger up and down the stem was wonky -- not working, pausing the music or shifting the bud, the seal I worked so hard to get, broke. Also, not having a real equalizer is a drawback. Apple has a customization wizard, but I like to have different settings for different genres of music. The customization wizard uses Apple's own sound track.On to the Sony's. I liked the Sony's. I have the WH-1000XM4 over the ear headphones for serious listening and they are great. But they are not suitable to wear for dog walking, bike rides or the gym. I need earbuds. The over the ears are also bulky to take on airplane flights taking up a lot real estate in my string pack or messenger bag. Anyway, I tried the 1000XM5's and liked them. The sound is very good as is the ANC. The three drawbacks are ease of fit, comfort and volume control. While easier to pass the seal fit test than the apples, it still took more futzing around than I care to do. Also, to pass the seal test, I had to use the large tips which hurt my ears after an hour. Finally, the four tap volume control is a pain. I either got know response or went back a track because I only tapped three times.So on to the Bose. Nirvana.Fit and Comfort. So easy to get a fit with their innovative tip and wing combo. The wings are really a small silicone gasket that fit inside your ear, but outside the ear canal. Select the right combo of tip and wing (sized independently) put them in your ear and you pass the fit test, first time, every time. I hardly feel them in my ears.Sound Quality. Superb. The Bose bathe me with aural warmth. I liked the Sony sound until I listened to the Bose. I would characterize the sound as warm but accurate. The Sony sound is like sunlight. The Bose sound is like an incandescent lamp. Despite the warmth, the sound is always clean and bright when it needs to be. I listen to a very wide range of music and the sound has been great for every genre. I think that classical music really tests the quality of an audio product due to the tonal range of instruments and voices and the variety of textures. Listening to Mozart's Requiem was sublime. It was like falling in love all over again. The immersion sound option raises the sound quality to a whole new level, bringing a depth and presence to the music. Just wow. And unlike the spatial music technology of Sony and Apple, immersion works for all sources. What I said about Mozart applies to any rock, jazz, and Latin that I have thrown out them. I've heard sounds, I've never heard before. The Bose app has a basic equalizer but I leave everything flat.ANC: Can't be beat. I can listen to quiet music while my wife is watching TV and it doesn't bother me. Sharp sounds such as a firecracker breakthrough but it's not a sensory deprivation chamber after all. I remember the early days of ANC -- it deadened the sound. Not these buds. The sound is alive and well. Can't wait to take them on my first flight in two weeks. And the aware mode is terrific. Just switch to aware and have a conversation without taking the buds out or when using them while on a bike ride.Controls: Work really well and sliding you finger to increase/decrease volume is easy, unlike my experience with the AirPod Pros. I learned that the double and triple taps to move forwards and backwards between tracks does not have to be super rapid. Overall, the touch controls work as well as the physical controls of my old Jabra's.Phone calls: Very secondary for me but so far they have worked just fine. I hear voices clearly and it seems that I am easily understood.Battery Life -- The only weakness- 4 hours with immersion on but I'm told with moderate volume, you can eke out 5 hours, enough for a cross country flight. And I will keep my over the ear Sony's up top in my carry on if I need them. I am not too concerned. Not concerned enough to take take a star off.Everybody's tastes are different. Some folks will be wed to Apple and it's ecosystem and the buds are $50 less. Sony has better battery life. But for me, Bose wins hands down for the combination of fit, comfort, sound quality, ANC and controls.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2023",AEIKQ37YHF6U6WLA6WYFP5ZCN7PA,True,373,Color: Black
R26M2Q2VUNC65D,B0CD2FSRDD,1.0 out of 5 stars Very Dissapointed,Richard A.,1,"I was forced to buy new earbuds becuase I accidentally left my old BOSE QC earbuds in my pants pocket and washed them. They would eventually power up but would not connect etc. so I opted for the new BOSE Ultra QC earbuds. But, the only thing ultra about these earbuds is that the sound quality is slightly better the the regular QC's and for me is the only Pro in my evaluation.I'll preface this with I use my earbuds on multiple devices. iPhone, iPad and laptop.Let's start with what I hate about the case.1. Its smaller then the regular QC's which is good for slipping them in your pocket. What I miss in this case is the indicator lights that show you the battery level of the case. The ultra case does not have this and haveing it is very helpful to me.2. With the regualer QC case you can also toggle between devices with the small button inside the case. Although the ultra case has this button on the back, its pretty much useless and barely has any functions. Its almost wasted effort in designn and manfacturing for BOSE.2.a With the button on the regular case you can press it once to see what device it is connected to. very simple and very useful. The ultra case does not do this. You have to open the BOSE app on your device to see where its connected AND you have to use the app to change devices. This may be my biggest issue. Its musch easier to just toggle the button on the case while the buds are in your ears to change evices. I don't want to have to get my phone out, open the app, wait for the app to connect , touch the earbud icon to see my choices and select what device I want. I simply want to toggle the button on the case.3. Trying to withdraw the earbuds from the case is not easy. The only way I can get them out of the case is by tugging on the rubber ear piece. I'm sure over time they will tear apart. This seems to not been thought through by the designers.Now lets go with the earbuds.1. They are small and I guess that's ok not much of an issue here except for the earpice options. While I have to use the largest option from the choice of 3; even the largest option isn't really big enough. It fits ok but not great. My regular QC's biggest option is larger and fits really good. I'm not sure why they didn't retain the same sizing options for the ultra.2. While using, you have to luanch the app to see the battery life. With the regular QC's you simply touch the left bud to hear the battery level. Again, very simple and useful.2.a Lets talk about battery life. While initially I just used my new ultras for conference calls and listening to videos while connected to my laptop and it all seemed good. Then one day, with a full charge, I went for a walk that lasted just over an hour. With about 10 minutes left on the walk I started getting low battery responses. I'm like, no way. I can't have this. I normally have several conference calls that last over an hour and I can't have these dying in the middle of a call. I also travel a lot by air and often have flights over 2 hours. So reason #1 why I returned them.3. The sound quality is very comprable for both and while the ultra may be slightly better but not worth the extra $$. I'm a sound nut and not opposed to spending extra doe for better quality but not here. Especially with the other issues I have for this version.All in all, I'm very dissapointed in BOSE's effort with the Ultra's. I have a lot of bose items and this is the first time I've been dissapointed in their products. So much so I sent the ultras back and purchased the regular QC noise cancelling earbuds like I had before. Now I'm happy again.","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2024",AGREXR2VJLD4T6F25CNXSPKTRCMA,True,192,Color: Black
R16C10L6CNMH9R,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent earbuds compared to competitor,hat,5,"I have tried both this and the equivalent unit made by Sony. A quick tl;dr would be if you want the best noise cancellation paired with excellent audio go with the Bose and if you want exceptionally excellent audio with okayish noice cancellation go with the Sony. As far as comparison:The way the Bose unti fits into the ear is both more confortable and the seal is more complete creating a significant increase in the noise cancellation ability. The Sony part does not completely fill the ear and it sometimes feels like thay are going to fall out due to their weight distribution paired with the ear canal fit.As far as audio the Sony really seems to have richer and more bold sound. The Bose audoo is also great, it just seemed a bit flatter compared to the Sony audio.Insofar as app connectivity- I avoid apps like the plague but I found connectivity w/o the app to be superior with the Bose. It lent itself to connection easier without having to rely exclusivly on app assistance. The Sony also has a known issue where it will fail to turn off even when placed in its case. I had this happen with the Bose as well but only once in awhile- with the Sony it was consistent and drained the battery constantly leading to a return.For me, personally, the Bose hit all the boxes and did it smoothly with finesse but, again, it basically comes down to Excellent Audio but connectivity issues and okay ANC go with Sony; Excellent ANC and comfort fit with good connectivity but not as good audio go with the Bose.","Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2024",AEAUJFSDYN7LYQYRXKXWWFFWBAIQ,True,17,Color: Moonstone Blue
R3GZFLYA715RWO,B0CD2FSRDD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great fit, great quality, great sound, great headphones",Mark M,4,"To put it up front, the only reason I'm not putting this at 5 stars is the lack of wireless charging and the size of this case.I have had the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro for the last 2 years, and I genuinely felt disdain towards them from very early on. I could never find a good ear fit, I bought several replacement ear buds, I did anything and everything I could. I got into running last summer and they'd stop detecting my ears, feel like they were falling out, and I constantly felt like they were not good fits for my ears.On a whim I decided to try these Bose QC Ultra buds, and it's night and day. The shape of these ear buds are definitely what my ears needed and they fit incredibly well. The little wings help them with reinforcement in my ears, and they just feel so much more natural. I also always struggled with the Buds 2 Pro's smaller size, where constantly having to adjust them within my ear would set off touch controls. Having a clear, distinct section of the ear buds that are meant to be touched is a welcome change to me in these Bose buds, and in general they're much easier to handle within my ears.Sound quality initially felt about on par with the Buds 2 Pro, but having listened to same sections of songs back to back, the Bose QC Ultra definitely are a step above. If the Buds 2 Pro were an 8/10 sound, I would put these at 9/10. Not a huge leap, but still a noticeable improvement in quality. The bass is strong (if you want), EQ is fully customizable with the low/mid/high ranges, and the volume is plenty loud for me.The battery life also has not been a huge issue for me yet. I've only had them a few days, but I've still used them for extended periods and still had plenty of battery life left. This may change as time goes on, but we'll see for that.Regarding the negatives, the lack of wireless charging is strange in this day and age. I also don't like how much larger this case is for charging, it's about 50% larger than the Buds 2 Pro case, which also supports full wireless charging. With such an increase in size and less features, it's strange to me. It's harder to carry these into the gym, where my Buds 2 Pro case fit neatly within my glasses case. It's not a huge change, but enough that my consolidated routine of keeping everything I needed in one section is a little more difficult now.Touch controls are also a little strange to get used to. You can stroke a finger from top to bottom of the touch section to lower volume, but it's such a small area that I typically end up just pausing the song I'm listening to. Play/Pause, next song, and previous song work great so far (Single Tap, Double Tap, Triple Tap respectively). I also wish there was a way to turn off the voice prompts for everything. For example, holding down my right bud turns on ""Quiet"" mode, which takes about 1-2 seconds of holding to activate. When it does activate, it lowers the volume on what you're listening for about a second while the voice says ""Quiet"", then brings the volume back up. I personally would prefer a simple audio queue to let me know it's activated and not interrupt my music. I also wish they could connect to multiple devices at once (like my Bose N700 do), but I knew that prior to purchasing and can't ding it for that.Overall the headphones are great with a few smaller issues I wish could be resolved. They're simple to sync up to any device, have great audio quality, fit my ears well at least, and feel like quality headphones. No issues with desync as others have mentioned (using S22 Ultra, also tried on Sony X85K TV with no issues).","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2024",AFRBYIVQCAMI5PMN435COKVAFVXQ,True,9,Color: Moonstone Blue
R2DOHVA8CEHQF9,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars Best earbuds I've ever owned!,Shara Simpson,5,"I bought these to replace Samsung Buds Pro2 that lasted a year before one stopped working and the other would barely connect. These Bose Ultras are by far superior in almost every way. The only things I miss are app related. The Samsung app had a ""Find my buds"" tracker and these don't appear to have anything similar. Also, there were more preset eq options and I could see how much battery was left in the buds and the case just by glancing at my phone without opening the app.1. Volume - much louder, at half the volume. Nice!2. Sound - Love the immersion settings. No distortion when I adjusted the bass boost all the way up. Clear, warm, crisp and full. I'm a basshead so I could do with even more bass TBH. I want my head to rattle when I have the bass boosted. The ""Aware"" setting amplifies outside sound to the point where I COULD eavesdrop on conversations if I wanted. The ANC settings are almost scarily quiet. Not so funny story: While I was testing the ANC I actually didn't hear the my fire alarm go off after I deliberately tripped it for testing purposes. I think you would want to be super careful using the ANC on this set if you're running/walking outside as well, because you won't hear cars or other people or really anything except your choice of music. It will be perfect for flights or the noisy cafeteria at work though.3. Fit - right out of the box I have a perfect fit and seal and they are COMFORTABLE enough to wear for hours without any ear fatigue. The style of these just fit my ear. I struggled daily with the Samsung buds and tried several different brands of eartips with no success. The left one fell out constantly no matter what size and style of eartip I tried.4. App - this is where it falls short. The app isn't as intuitive as Samsung's or as loaded with options. If I misplace my earbuds there isn't a way to track them with a beeping sound or location.5. The look - these are just better looking all around, and the blue color is gorgeous.6. Battery life - not great when using immersion and quiet settings. A few hours max usage when fully charged. This is truly disappointing but they do fast charge, and I won't need ANC all the time so... it's not a deal breaker for me.7. Mic - tested outside and inside, no one could hear background noise even in the cafeteria. My voice was clear and didn't sound tinny or robotic.They get 5 stars regardless due to the amazing sound and fit. Highly recommend 👌","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2024",AFPBVELJBKTT3FYLFSJ7RHINHVFA,True,1,Color: Moonstone Blue
R3JCD29TZSAK36,B0CD2FSRDD,2.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic sound but just misses the mark...at least for Iphone users.,Kristi M. King,2,"I so badly wanted to love these earbuds. My older, very nice, air pod pros had been confiscated by my wife. And at the prompting of a buddy (an audiophile) I bought the Bose QC Ultra ear buds. I'll state up front that the sound is amazing. I can do without the immersion mode, though. It's kind of neat but I can hear a sort of ""syntheticness"" that takes away from the music. I much preferred ""quiet mode"". I have no experience with the older Bose earbuds, but suspect you could own a pair of really great, older earbuds at a much better price point.Here are my problems with the Bose QC Ultras. Connection to the iphone is pretty hit and miss. If you can't get it to connect, you can probably sort out the situation in 2 - 10 minutes. But that gets old real fast. I have a 7 year old and can only workout at 5am. Spending 5 minutes in the parking lot trying to connect my ear buds to my phone is infuriating. First world problems, I know, but they cost too much and the nitwits at Bose know full well there is an issue and that it could be better. It wasn't just my phone that had issues. It would randomly disconnect and have issues with my Nvidia shield.The second major issue has to do with volume during calls and online meetings. The volume is SIGNIFICANTLY reduced compared to that of the apple air bud pros. It's just not useable. You cannot make it louder. If you're in a quiet room, fine. But if you're going for a walk or out in public, you are not going to be able to hear. And you can look this up...it's an issue. Again, come on, Bose. You know full well that phone calls need to be louder. Music is plenty loud, so what's going on? Big fail.The 3rd thing is that sometimes, not always, when listening to music you can hear a sort of ""sputtering"" going on with the music. I can tell you that the ear buds were NOT too far away from the audio source. And the batteries were charged. I typically listen to music through Amazon HD Music. So maybe the issue was on Amazon's end. Maybe.Again, I wanted to love these ear buds. I heard parts and layers in songs I had not heard before. The bass is rich and deep. It's really good. I suspect that if you did NOT use your ear buds for calls and you owned an Android phone, these ear buds might be great. But not if you are an apple user. So I'll sacrifice the audio greatness of the Bose for the pretty great audio quality of the Apple air bud pros (Gen 2). The interfacing with other apple products is just so good. And the Apple air buds do sound great, too.I was also told, but didn't explore this idea, that the Bose app is the problem regarding bluetooth connection. The notion is that if it is removed, an Apple user might not have any connection issues (letting the bluetooth software built into an Apple iOS or computer take over). That wasn't going to work for me because I also own the Bose L1 Pro16 PA system. I have to keep the Bose app on my phone.On a positive note (regarding the Ultras) the comfort is amazing and the battery life is really awesome, too.So that's my experience. Hope this helps. All for trying out any new Bose ear buds that move the ball forward.I googled the issues above and plenty of people were experiencing the same thing. And Bose decided to ignore it. Bose employs really smart people. Not fixing these issues is just declaring that you don't care.Hopefully this review saves you some time and energy.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AGITNHV4TGIJD2QTRHUAYMHCMC5A,True,7,Color: Black
R1H3D43QM4MOQ4,B0CD2FSRDD,"3.0 out of 5 stars The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Earbuds - A good set, but not at the price",Susan A. Dunlap,3,"I was looking for some new earbuds to take with me on casual walks and for engaging in general listening sessions to relax. I've been a fan of Bose products for a while now and was eager to give these earbuds a try shortly after their release as my original Bose QC earbuds recently broke after two years of use. My review will be broken down into three categories: Features and Function, Comfort, and Sound and Battery Life.Features and Function - these earbuds need to be registered to a valid Bose customer account to be properly used. I have no problem with it as I currently own one other Bose product. However, I have noticed that there were times I could not properly access the headphones in the Bose Music App when I was engaged in my music. This more commonly occurred after around 45 minutes of continuous listening. I've also noted times when the earbuds were not in perfect sync with one another, and I've had to take them in and out at times to readjust them to my ears. However, the app does allow you to modify your preferred EQ (albeit a simplified one) and touch control settings, toggle immersion mode, and provide a way to check whether a proper ear seal has been achieved for both buds to help optimize your listening experience. Where Bose was potentially greedy here was the decision not to provide the included case with a wireless charging capability (they now offer a case with this feature for $50 extra). The call quality on these is decent, but nothing noteworthy compared to the competition.Comfort - By far, the most comfortable earbuds I have ever tested. The earbuds are relatively light, which helped them stay in my ears. I experienced no listening fatigue while wearing them with ANC on. On the note of ANC, these are also exceptionally great at isolating lower frequencies and could very well be among the best the market has to currently offer as other reviews might attest.Sound and Battery Life - This is in part where the earbuds fell short of my expectations. If you are prioritizing sound quality over ANC use, it might be more preferrable to look elsewhere. In this generation, the QC Ultras offers an immersion setting with two modes that provide uniquely different experiences, and turning this setting on does improve the sound quality incrementally at the cost of around 2 hours of battery life assuming this setting remains on for one full cycle. Even in adjusting the provided EQ, there were times that I felt the sound was a little off on the highs, but they do a good job on the mid-range tones and have a desirable the bass response (this is where the sound improvement, compared to the original QCs, was most notable).Now to the big question - are they worth the $300 price tag? In short, probably not. In summary, they have a good (not great) sound, exquisite comfort and ANC capabilities, and a simple set of settings that can be modified via the Bose Music App, but do not provide other features such as wireless charging for the included case that you might expect at this price point. Placing these earbuds at 3 stars is the best I can do for the time being, and I hope this motivates Bose to do a little better when they come out with their next set of earbuds. These were returned.","Reviewed in the United States November 5, 2023",AEWD5BBOB5BS5PJCXKN6NRXSOIQQ,True,14,Color: Black
R3V9MZ2JQX8AFY,B0CD2FSRDD,"5.0 out of 5 stars Love the sound quality, but don't fit as well as Sports buds",Amazon Customer,5,"I'm sharing the difference between the Bose sports buds and these QC Ultra. Which do I prefer? I'm still on the fence. It's the same as android vs iohone. They both have cons and pros.So what's my experience of wearing Bose earbuds? I wear the buds nearly everyday. In fact, I wear them 6-10 hours all day, at least 5 days a week. I am a highly active person. A fitness instructor, farmer's wife, country farm girl who cans and freezes all her garden produce and cares for the 6 acre yard, I have my buds in nearly everyday, all day long.Pros to QC Ultra:The sound is INCREDIBLE! The 3 different modes are crazy good! Perfect for whatever atmosphere you desire! Can't hear the LOUD white noise of the inside of aircraft, can't hear the mower when mowing the yard, can't hear water running when washing dishes. Turn in immersion and you hear everything perfectly 👌Compared to Bose Sports buds, the buds I bought new twice, new in 2017 (lost this pair) and 2019 (didn't hold a charge more than 10 mins in mid 2023), were not as loud, clear or had the 3 different listening modes. They may have improved in all these areas.Cons to QC Ultra: The buds won't stay in my ears if I move around much. Examples would be 1. outside getting up, kneeling down, wiping sweat off of forehead while gardening, 2. the natural vibrations while mowing, 3. while singing along with the music talking and 4. Talking on the phone to someone since the jaw is moving the buds slightly, causing them to loosen and eventually fall out.Second: if you have long hair, wear hoodies or have your hands/arms moving by your head, you will activate the buds to perform a command. Mine will switch songs, change listening modes or end a social media app. Even my wet hair will trigger the mode changes. Blow drying my hair will change the modes. But when I tap it purposefully to pauce the music or change the listening mode, it doesn't consistently respond to the touch of my finger.This gets alittle frustrating when it appears the buds are so sensitive to touch but my own finger touching it with purpose doesn't consistently produce the same results.3. These buds don't have a push button. They are only activated if they malfunction (stop responding in a way that you desire) by reinserting them into their case. This is aggrivating when I'm mowing or in the garden. Either I have to go get the case to reset them or carry the case with me wherever I go around my house and outside property. Ugh!! I wish they had a reset button like the Bose Sports. I could turn them on/off and reset, and even engage them to switch the BT device I wanted them to switch to.*So my review is meant to only serve as a tool to help you choose which you think would work best for you! If you need excellent music quality and clear crisp sounding videos, these are for you! The sound quality blows Galaxy buds & apple buds and away in my opinion. The only sound quality I've ever heard was Beats padded headphones. I'm not talking loud and blary or hearing the 5 string quartet crisp. I'm talking about hearing every instrument with perfect ease, easy to allowing your own mind switch and focus in on the the sax, to the drums, to the lead vocals, to the bass guitar kind of listening. A perfect blend of separate sounds. It's crazy! You can enjoy loud music from the sounds of the amazing Trans-Siberian Orchestra concert to a hard, bass-thumpin' NF or Aerosmith song. Anyone can listen to a band on a lesser quality set of buds with less instruments and hear the different sounds well. These Bose QC Ultra buds allow you to experience the beautiful chaos inside a ""loud"" concert and thoroughly enjoy each individual piece that creates the experiencial masterpiece!If you just need good music quality and know that the little quirks of the buds falling out and the sensitively of the buds will push you over the edge everyday, then I would recommend the sports buds.I honestly am not sure which I would choose if I bought another pair. I hope the sports buds have this same music quality. If so, I'd get them. If the sports buds don't have the music quality, well, I honestly don't know. I guess I'll tell you which I decide upon then, in another 3 years if these quit holding a charge (or God-forbid that I lose them).","Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2024",AHZ5EKN4AKBQTGHAMIO2F2OO6SNA,True,1,Color: Black
RI51AIMRYSJOQ,B0CD2FSRDD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Very good, but not as good as my old wired Bose QC20",SAChapman,4,"Bought these after being disappointed in the latest Sony earbuds which was said to have the second-best noise cancellation after Bose. But the Sony's ANC was disappointing to me having come from the Bose QC20 which was like having an ""off"" switch for the world. The QC20 are great, and I only replaced them due to a lack of a headphone jack on my latest phone. (Sigh.)The Sonys were also not comfortable for multi-hour flights, so I finally broke down and bought these, the latest Boise earbuds with ANC. Unfortunately, the ANC is still a half-step behind the much older QC20. I don't know why that is, but it is. But it is noticably better than Sony's. The Bose is also more comfortable, but again a half step behind how comfortable the QC20 was.The bigger issue with these buds is that they seem slightly slow to react to inputs. More than once I've tapped them, thought that the pause/play function was missed, tapped again, only for the audio to start then stop as both commands eventually went through. Connectivity to the app is also not consistently good. Worse, I've had them drop the connection for no apparent reason. They also can't be connected to multiple devices at the same time, which other ear buds do and would be really convenient at times. Indeed swapping the connection from the phone to the tablet and back feels overly complicated as the most reliable way is to disable bluetooth on both devices, then enable it on the one you want the earbuds to connect to. The Sonys are much better in this regard.So while overall, I like the Bose better than the Sony, I can't give the Bose 5 stars because I feel like the product has come up short from where it should be. Great ANC doesn't matter when the connection drops.","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AFF6K4NFYP2MK5IGCAYKAIB4UT3Q,True,0,Color: Black
R2T5LDS0PL1182,B0CD2FSRDD,4.0 out of 5 stars Great noise cancelling but waaay too sensitive,Kat312,4,"I did a lot of research to find noise cancelling earbuds to drown out the banging when someone at the gym runs at full speed on the treadmill next to me. With regular headphones I could barely hear my own music over the smack, smack, smack of jogger. First I cheaped out and bought the Soundcore A40 earbuds which came highly rated for the price. I liked the app and the options better than the Bose, but the Bose noise cancelling is much better. CONS: 1. The touchpad area on the Bose earbuds are way too sensitive. If I'm wearing a sunhat with a string that keeps the hat on, the earbuds turn on and off repeatedly when the string gets too close to the earbuds. If my long hair blows in the wind - the earbuds also construe it as a ""tap"" and turns off the music. Very annoying! 2. The Soundcore app had many more options for ""programming"" the earbuds - one tap vs. 2 taps, etc. so I was able to DISABLE the ""one tap"" option that stopped & started the music. Bose needs to add this option to their app, as there are very few options and most of them are related to what ""mode"" you want for noise cancelling (immersion, aware...etc.) . I still use the Soundcore earbuds on the walk to the gym in order to avoid the annoyance of the Bose earbuds turning on and off. Then I switch when I get to the gym.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2024",AEN7FNCWPDPQS4USWSKYYZIM3YXA,True,0,Color: Moonstone Blue
R268I7PKW1CQJJ,B0CD2FSRDD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Superior noise canceling and sound quality, compatibility with apple products lacking",RLambright,4,"Pros: I have worn these on a plane, while mowing the lawn and while standing next to a gas powered generator and they work great while blocking nearly 90-95% of the outside noise. Sound quality is superior to any ear buds I have owned. I enjoy a little more base when listening to music so using the app I was able to get the sound set to my liking. Rechargeable carrying case is light and the battery life is good, though less than others but using the full Emersion sound accounts for some of this. In my opinion it’s worth the trade off. It’s great to ditch the giant headphones on planes and still get great noise canceling and sound quality.Cons:There are conflicts when connecting with other devices. My Powerbeats ear buds would allow two connections to both my iPad and iPhone and the ear buds would switch automatically depending on which I was using. Sadly the Bose earbuds don’t do this so I am constantly having to manually connect them when switching using the Bose App. Volume control, pause and skip are touchy and I find myself pausing the music accidentally or skipping to the next song. Powerbeats uses a physical button push which feels more interactive. I started using my phone to control volume, pause or skip songs but I found once I do this, the Bose earbud controls are over ridden and stop responding to attempts to control my media. I don’t use the pause button when attempting to have a conversation I just remove them. There is no way to add the Earbuds to the “Find my Device” App on IPhone and Bose does not have this feature. I misplaced them while on Vacation and learned quickly to always but them back in the case when not using them.I would still recommend them due to their superior noise canceling and sound quality. It’s nice to be able to ditch the giant headphones on planes but I wish Bose would have fixed some of the above issues.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AHTZGQY64YBPXTALSFX4237GQHRA,True,0,Color: Black
R4BI2REEBZZO4,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars I don't work in an office.,Julie,5,"I don't work in a peaceful environment with timid people, who are respectful of each other and know how to shut up. No.I work in a warehouse. Not a good warehouse. A small warehouse. With 30 people in a single room. People who literally SCREAM along with the music playing over the speakers. People who think being the most annoying person possible is funny. What's worse. It's 10 hour shifts.I've had enough. I decided, time for noise canceling headphones!! This review is for someone in the same position as me. That NEEDS, DESPERATELY, some way to shut down the noise around them.After much debate, I decided between two choices. The Jlab Epic Lab True Edition (200 USD) and the new Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones. (250 USD)I went with these two because1) I was very interested how jlabs new signature headphones would compare to the 20$ version they offer. I wondered how much better it could be for 200$, also I was interested in the Knowles corporation equalizer preset. Big audio company.2) Bose is the leader of ANC headphones. I've never had a pair so I had to see what the fuss was about.I got both of these on Amazon knowing I can return the worst pair within 30 days.After using these, I want to apologize to my past self for not doing this sooner. I have broken them in over the past week at work, and it's the only time I have been there I haven't wanted to walk out within hours or gotten crazy depressed. I realized. I actually like my job.Let's start with jlab I'm going to get this out of the way. If you relate to my situation at all. These are not the headphones for you.IF you have a good life. A good job. One without people literally screaming in your ear 10 hours. Please get these.The audio quality on these are amazing. I was shocked. I honestly teared up when putting my favorite song on for first time. I heard parts of that song I have NEVER heard. You will experience this. The Knowles setting is life changing. These are a daily driver for sure. I am impressed. Comfortable and very water resistant.The active noise canceling is actually pretty good. I could barely hear my husband with music on. But my situation....multiple...people...yelling, in union, to Taylor swift.The jlabs can not handle it lol. It does get muffled...a bit. Which honestly, is loads better than just white knuckling it. But if you are looking for strictly ANC, don't get these at 200$. Are they worth 200$ on sound quality alone. Gods yes. Are they worth that...to ME. Ehh..Bose.Honestly I was not expecting to like these as much. I heard a lot of things about loss of connectivity plus not being water resistant. In my warehouse. I do get water on my hands sometimes so I did not have high hopes. But let me tell you.The second I put these on at work, before the music played it did the ANC switch and I was the happiest I have been in months. It instantly took out the warehouse music, the machines, the fans, the background noises and 80% of the talking. I felt like I could breathe for once. The overstimulation gone like *snaps*.Then the music started playing. I was watching my coworkers mouths and I broke out in a huge grin that lasted minutes. I could see them talk, but hear them talk I could not. This is the first week in months where I didn't get depressed after about 30 minutes of that.So the ANC is legendary. The sound...is not. I keep looking at my jlabs like... ???How do they sound so much better?!I think the bose default settings out of box is just too treble heavy. I used the app to set mine +9, +4, -2.That is the closest I can get it to sound like jlabs but they still don't. Why?! I don't know why. They still do sound good. Like a 8/10. That plus not hearing my coworkers discuss if lobsters have souls, makes this purchase on sale at $250 a steal for me.I'm going to be returning the Jlabs and looking for a future sale.

R2J2VUX3PY8PYC,B0CD2FSRDD,3.0 out of 5 stars Red flags,DL,3,"I'm a professional musician and an earbud connoisseur...I live in New York City and depend on ANC earbuds for the subway, street, and listening to music and podcasts, etc... So I need very strong noise cancellation and pretty good detail in the sound (for actual editing and review I'd use a flat open ear set of cans, of course).These earbuds have a nice, warm sound and I guess I'm fortunate that they make a good seal in my particular ear opening so the ANC does the trick just about anywhere. The fit is snug so they don't fall out and I can wear them comfortably for a long time. Those are the positives.The negatives:• The tap activation on the buds is waaaay too sensitive, so the simplest adjustment makes an action (starting, stopping play, activating assistant, and so on). Very annoying but even more annoying if you're on a call and go to adjust the bud and you inadvertently hang up.• The Bluetooth is not intuitive at all and gets wonky. Often it won't connect to my iPhone on a call until I place them back in the charger and reset the thing. In the other direction, the other day my phone wouldn't pick up because the buds remained connected *even* after they were sitting in the case in another room!• Taking calls on the street is an issue because these buds do very little to suppress the sound of wind. My AirPods Pro are fantastic at this--I ask people if they can hear the wind or sirens going by and they say either they barely hear it or not at all. Using these Bose on a slightly windy day the person I called had a lot of trouble hearing me.• Having to buy an additional $50 charger for wireless charging is a suspect business practice when most all others at this price have it standard--not to mention it's wasteful. If I buy the wireless case, I may as well throw out the previous one• The simple act of taking the buds out of the case is difficult, which again at this price point and state of engineering/design simply shouldn't be.TL;DR if you're an Apple user, these earbuds take the connectivity and charging issues of AirPods Pro and multiply them several times over. My APP have an occasional issue, but these new Bose have already had significant glitches. The sound might be a little better on the Bose, and the comfort is better too, but that's where it all ends.The Beats I've tried fit nicely but are lower quality across the board. The B&W P17s have good sound but are unwieldy and uninspired. The Creative Aurvana have great sound at half the price but none of the bells and whistles (worth checking out though)So yeah, three stars and unfortunately dropping... I'd be happy to give the company feedback directly, and may well do so on their site.","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2024",AHC42OT56MREK5MA5WFU6233TGIA,True,4,Color: White Smoke

They ‘stick out’ quite a bit from your ears and tend to fall off frequently… they are on the heavy side… then after a while they stopped charging while in their charging case or one earbud would partially charge and the other wouldn’t… they do not hold the charge either like advertised, it could be that I received a bad set of course, but I had no choice but to Return them and ask for a Replacement.. Will see how those earbuds turn out… the Sound:… initially I thought it was great, but then when I also purchased another pair of earbuds from a different Brand… the Bose did just as well as the less expensive ones… so I will closely compare one vs the other and decide which one to keep… my goal here is to be totally satisfied with my purchase and consider the Budget… price after all is important nowadays….","Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2024",AG2TRNI3GUIKFAXTHB5IT2GXYFOQ,True,0,Color: Black
R3J05OX8EWOYBR,B0CD2FSRDD,2.0 out of 5 stars For Audio & Music - Great! / For Phone Calls - Horrible!,SKova,2,"I used these on an iPhone 12 Pro Max. While I was tempted to get a new set of Echo Buds 2, I wanted to try the Bose QC Earbuds. With there being a $50 discount at the time, I went for it, even after reading some of the mixed reviews. Here is are the positives and the negatives.Positives:- These earbuds fit is fantastic. The supplied silicon ear pieces and ""wings"" made the fit simple and snug. I could wear them for extended periods and did not experience any pain. They are also very easy to insert into your ears with no problems.- Sounds quality for Audio Sources (except for Phone calls) is amazing. I was very happy with the sound quality and how balanced it sounds. If I was only to use them for listening to Music and Movies (connected to my TV to listen in private), I would keep them. Having compared to the AirPods Pro 2 that I have now, they were better. The APP2 lack some of the highs that were very clean in the Ultras.- The Aware and Quiet modes (ANC) work extremely well. The Echo Buds 2 had a very good ANC and the passthrough was pretty good. On the Bose, the Aware Mode is awesome and the Quiet Mode is fantastic. I could mow the lawn in Quiet Mode and really not hear the tractor.- The Battery Life is very good, they would last the published times without any problems.- Placing the earbuds in the case was very easy and they would not fall out. The magnets that pull them into place are very strong.- Switching between two phones was best accomplished just using the Bluetooth settings from the phone, not the Bose App as is reported to do.Negatives:- Phone Calls are by far the worst of anything that I have ever tried. This is the primary reason that I returned these just before writing this review. The volume for phone calls (only phone) is about 50% or less than the maximum volume of any other audio sources. In other reviews here and other forums, it is the most common complaint by far from all others. My first call was while outside walking and my party could not understand me very well and I could not hear them with Aware Mode or Quiet Mode. I tried a few other calls and they were all bad, with the last one where I needed to switch to the phone from the earbuds where I decided that these were being sent back. I even contacted Bose to see what they would say.- Connection only to one device at a time, is a disappointment. Almost all others support Multi-Point, this was a shortcoming. I did have trouble getting it to connect to an iPad Air 2, not sure if it is the older iPadOS or what. Never got back to solving that.- Case only supports USB-C for charging, not a deal breaker, you would think it would be part of a high-end product.- Support from Bose was very disappointing. I could not find a way to enter a support ticket on their website, was able to make contact through X with DM messages to their support team. They did not answer everything that I wrote and did not address the main issue correctly. I told them that I cannot hear other parties on a phone call, they twice sent me links about getting the microphone positioned better. Not hearing the other party, has nothing to do with the mic. They also sent me a link for over the ear headphones, which was not even the product that I have, they knew that too as they had the Serial Number and referenced what I had.I really wanted these to work, as I like all of my other Bose products. So disappointed that they could not acknowledge that there are reports of Phone Call issues and they are working on it. I might have waited.If you want them for audio, they are great. If you are going to make phone calls, you will most likely be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AEHL4ZYEE3VIP4E4EIPTOVJ64LNQ,True,0,Color: Black
R1CAQMDLZ50UJT,B0CD2FSRDD,"4.0 out of 5 stars 10 out of 10 noise cancelling, call quality is lacking",KP,4,"These earbuds are probably some of the best you can buy if you're looking for top quality noise cancelling. Turning on the active noise cancelling for the first time and hearing the background noise around you disappear is an experience. With noise cancelling on, you won't have to turn the volume up too loud since it mutes background noise so well. You also won't hear cars coming when you walk, or anyone walking up behind you, so keep safety in mind, the noise cancelling is that good!The sound quality on these is up to the quality you'd expect from Bose. There is a basic equalizer within the app (bass, mid, treble). There is also an immersive audio feature which makes it sound like you're in the middle of a stage with the audio expanded around you.The earbuds come with different sizes of rubber-like buds and ""wings"" that go around the unit to help stabilize them in your ear.I have a few complaints that make these earbuds a 4 out of 5 stars for me.First, the Bose app can be finicky, losing connection with the buds and it can be difficult to get them to reconnect.Second, the call quality is pretty atrocious for the person on the other end. Running water, crinkling bags, wind blowing, and any other background noise comes through so loudly on the other person's end that I've had multiple people complain and offer to call me back when I can talk on the phone instead of the earbuds. This is a well known problem that people have posted online about for years and somehow Bose has not fixed it. For $300 this shouldn't be an issue.Third, these should come with wireless charging. You can get the Bose wireless charging case for these for $50, making the total package for these $350. Again, for $300 I believe these should come with the ability to wirelessly charge without the need for another pricey accessory.All in all I absolutely recommend these despite the complaints, in fact I have a coworker who picked up a pair after I raved about mine.","Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2024",AERYWWI5H6SDI3S7AWTETMXTKP5A,True,5,Color: Black

They seem to do much better if you don't use the app.I want to say I have had Bose speaker systems in the past and all been 5 Stars and I really wish I could say the same here.The comfort is exactly what I was looking for, I love the ovoid shape ear tips that fit right in the ear, great seal. The sound is phenomenal no doubt but I'm getting the same rather high pitched screeching on just the left bud as others have mentioned. I'll probably write Bose and ask if I exchange these will I still have this problem...and then decide whether to keep them or go with the QC 2 instead or perhaps just go with Sony until Bose comes out with an updated model hopefully fixing the issues.For $300 or $250 I really don't think connection and screeching issues should exist at all and I don't understand that for such a perfect product otherwise why these problems couldn't have been fixed before release??Like many others I'm on the quest for perfect earbuds and these were sooo close and it's such a shame.

R1XMXCXGG6R0R8,B0CD2FSRDD,4.0 out of 5 stars Not worth the cost,M.B.,4,"These are better than my Sony WF-C700N. They're more comfortable, the noise cancelation is better, and the bass is better.They are not more than three times as expensive better, though.They also have annoying problems.1.) The left earbud likes to make low volume high pitched bleeping noises, making it had to use them as just noise cancelling earplugs. I end up having to play white noise just to drown out the annoying noise.2.) The noise floor is high. Sitting there with nothing playing not connected to anything there's a definite low level white noise. Have you ever stood outside on a frigid winter day in the woods, when there's no wind and no animal noises? It's like that. It's not unpleasant but it's there.3.) Annoying connectivity problems with my Sony XBR-85X900F. Sometimes I have to turn the TV off and back on to get audio to play, even when it shows connected.4.) Lack of LEDs to display status on the earbuds. My $35 Chinese special earbuds have these for crying out loud.5.) They smelled weird out of the packaging, almost a moldy smell. It's still there even after having used them for a month. Not fun when you're shoving them in your ears.6.) Battery life is only OK, and with some of the sound options turned on becomes pretty bad.They do a good job at drowning out the incessant train noise, barking dogs abandoned to be bored in their back yards all day, and my annoying neighbors that all cut their mufflers off during the ""C"".The bass is strong, especially with bass boost turned on.Overall sound quality is good, if the volume of what you're listening to is high enough to drown out the high sound floor.Honestly though, you can get 80% of the performance of these for less than a third of the price. These are only worth buying if you have money to burn. They also need firmware updates to handle the annoying glitches.","Reviewed in the United States March 27, 2024",AHDHJIX6PJWHFKSYNWBBLHRXACCA,True,5,Color: Black
R1VT3M76LMYOQI,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars Wow!,WarEagleX,5,"So, I just left my beloved Sony 1000XM5s on the plane and decided to try these out since the Sony's are ranked #1 and these are ranked #2. So this is a Sony vs Bose review.1) The first thing I noticed when putting these on is how much less pressure and weight are on their ear and ear canal. The weight is distributed so these disappear and you forget you're wearing them. I liked the Sony's in-ear design since they are less visible and I wasn't sure what I felt about Bose's style, but having them in - I like them, they're sleek and sexy.2) The Bose app is much better looking than the Sony app. Yes the Sony has more functions but the app is like something from the 1990s while the Bose app is sleak simple and useful. Also, the Bose app tells me the airbuds are charging when not in ear while the Sony app just says disconnected and that's that.3) The Sony case is smaller and sleaker but the 1000XM5's new plastic is slippery. They get oil from your skin which makes taking them out of the case quite interesting. The Bose is much easier to grip and remove out of the case. Unfortunately, the Bose case does not have wireless charging which is a shame.4) Bose's noise canceling is superior to Sony's - as you would expect for anything bearing the QuietComfort logo. Because they are so light on the ears and the silence you create, you forget that you're not simply in a quiet room. It's a big win for a road warrior like me who's on a plane every week.5) The music sound stage vs Sony is a matter of taste. I listen to EDM so the soundstage and bass is magnificent on the Bose. I listed to my playlist on these and got goosebumps. It was like hearing many of the songs for the first time - especially in immersion mode. The Sony's were also excellent, but the Bose seems like it is more ""professional,"" if that makes sense.6) Battery life. Yeah, so if you use immersion mode, you have a horrific 2 hours of battery life. That's barely any good for a short flight. I would imagine about a 4 - 5 hour life on the Bose. But then again, I only got about 4 1/2 hours of life on the 1000XM5. So as long as I can get music for most of a transcon flight I'm okay. I don't mind charging 20 minutes for another 2 hours.So the verdict - I have to say I think the Bose Ultra is the best NC earbud, squeezing out a win over the excellent Sony 1000XM5.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2024",AHSAHFTGP7YDX74AZA7U3HYGQN5Q,True,11,Color: Black

I never write reviews, but this product warranted it, especially given the unfairly large amount of negative reviews.

R2Y1T8BV9EOOPM,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars BOSE: Does not dissapoint,Gabe,5,"Over the course of the last several years, I have had several different types of headphones. My job allows me the time to listen to anything while I work. I started with some Bose Quiet Comfort several years back (which i still have and they work fine). Bass and clarity on the Bose QC is phenomenal, but using it for calls was a bit of a problem because the clarity on the microphone was a bit lacking, but for music and everything else, amazing. I decided to try a pair of Beats Studio 3's which were also amazing, a bit better when making calls and had a little more loudness than the BQC's. I stuck with those for several years, a pair stopped working, I bought another pair and still have those and have another brand new pair in reserve that I got at a good price...just in case. I tried a pair of AKG in ear headphones that were good. I tried some Samsung buds which were decent but less bass than I liked, which the AKG possessed. This past Christmas I decided to try the Beats Buds and they were better than both the AKG and the Samsung buds, in volume, clarity, and bass. I like a lot of bass in my music and the Beats buds seem to work well and the bass was good. Still, always felt there there may be better out there either way...even as good as these Beats were.There was.I bought these Bose Quiet Comfort Ultras to see if THESE could be ""that better"" that I was searching. They were more than better. The sound quality is off the charts, with the app you can adjust the bass and it is mind blowing. I was working and I could hear the buzz of the air conditioner, but when I put on these headphones: silence. I thought the AC turned off by chance, right when I put the headphones on...I took them out...and all i could hear was the AC. These headphones silenced everything around me, all I could hear was my breathing. I was in shock. I still am. The music quality is unlike any headphones I have had. I've only used them for 3 days, but my God, Bose really is on another level. I will see how these last but if these first 3 days are any indication, I am sure I will be in heaven for as long as I have these. I haven't really messed with the app yet, but I am sure that it will make these headphones even better.If you are wondering if there is anything better out there like I did: There is. Give these a try...its Bose.

R1NKXX3175EXHL,B0CD2FSRDD,1.0 out of 5 stars When will I learn my lesson that Bose is not for me?,Amazon Customer,1,"I'm on a never-ending quest for good noise-cancelling earbuds. I work from home and need to block out the incesscent noise from neighborhood leaf blowers and the creepy ice cream truck that loops through our neighborhood every day. But I also need to focus and can't stand music that's too loud, so I need the volume to be able to adjust very low. I'd prefer more than 8 hours of listening time but I know that's a stretch for earbuds with good ANC.So far, the two best pairs I've found for my purposes are the Sony LinkBuds S and the Soundcore by Anker Liberty 3 Pro. The Edifier TWS1 PRO and Soundcore by Anker Space A40 have also not been too bad, although the ANC and the volume reduction is not where I need them to be. I also use an older pair of Apple airpods with my Apple devices. They're probably the most comfortable but the noise-cancelling and volume reduction isn't good enough for my needs.Most days, I switch betwen the Sony pair and the Liberty 3. The Sonys fit so well. They're comfortable. The sound is great. The noise cancelling is pretty good, some leaf blower noise sometimes creeps in. The Liberty 3s are a little bulky but the sound is good and the volume reduction is the best out of all the many earbuds I've tried. The noise-cancelling is good but not great. Those pesky high notes from the ice cream always slip in and the drone of leafblowers in the background is usually still present, although they bring it down to a tolerable level.Now that it's Spring, the windows are open and the leafblowers are out, I got in my head that I needed to resume my quest for the perfect earbuds. In case the technology has magically improved so much in the last two years, I guess. Everything I've read online names the Bose QuietComfort Ultra as the best for noise-cancelling and sound. Well, I've had Bose headphones in the past and was seriously underwhelmed. Not being able to lower the volume low enough to focus and work was my biggest complaint. For just listening to music for fun, they're great but I need my earbuds/headphones as a work tool. Not only does the volume not lower enough, when I'm not thinking about it and try to lower the volume a click and they're already at their lowest setting, they give you this obnoxious, jarring ""bong"" noise that scares the crap out of me. I never figured out how to get rid of that so my headphones have been collecting dust for the last four years. Since it's been a while and everyone still raves about Bose, I thought maybe they've improved.NOPE. These QuietComfort Ultra buds are so insanely loud, even on the lowest setting. Even dropping the EQ to -10 across the board doesn't help. The immersive audio is actually nice. I like it. Again, if I only wanted to listen and enjoy music, they sound great. Well, except for the ANC. The ANC is so loud and fuzzy, I feel like a dog with my head hanging out of the window with these in. Seriously? THIS fuzzy static is the exceptional noise-cancelling people rave about? My $79 Liberty 3 Pros don't sound like I'm going through a wind tunnel, why do the $300 Bose? As I'm sitting here typing this, I just caught the high tinkling notes of the ice cream truck too. It definitely blocks more of that annoying jingle than any other buds I've tried but...that's about the only thing it excels at.I'm not an audiophile by any means, so I'm sure I'm not using the right technical terms. I have noise-sensitivity issues (obviously) and I need to have long periods of extreme concentration while I'm working. I have like three things I want a pair of earbuds to do. Block out irritating, rage-inducing noises, play music at an extremely low volume, and be comfortable. Maybe that's too much to ask? I've tried a few different price points and can not quite find exactly what I need. I feel duped by all the people who review Bose with such glowing praise, that has just not been my experience with any of their products (I have one of their speakers too that's just meh.)Will I have learned my lesson, that Bose is not for me? Only time will tell. I wish Amazon still allowed people to comment on reviews, becuase I'd love to know if any more experienced audio lovers have some suggestions for me.","Reviewed in the United States May 17, 2024",AFZKLW6LMGR3THTDJQPE3L25FU5A,True,9,Color: Moonstone Blue
RJJPQB51VQDF1,B0CD2FSRDD,"5.0 out of 5 stars Full review! Overall, highly recommend!",Shelley B,5,"The media could not be loaded. Since the Bose noise canceling earbuds are so expensive, I felt that it was important to do a full review. I have a neurological disorder that requires me to be able to control the sound in my environment. One of the requirements is noise canceling. It is important to note, that these are not 100% noise canceling. That being said, there is a quiet mode that does an amazing job of blocking out a large majority of volume. It worked so well that I didn’t even hear if my car was running. There are some other fantastic features on here. I tried to put some screenshots so you could see what the app looks like. One of the great features is the ability to control the amount of base and travel you are able to hear. In my case, the base to the lowest level was important. You can also set various modes as your favorites. And then you can even set it up to remember the last mode you set the earbuds to.Another great feature, as you are able to scroll through the various modes that you have starred as your favorites, by just touching and holding which ever earbud you want to use as your shortcut. In my case, I actually set it up for both so I didn’t have to remember.The immersive sound feature is great for those who are really looking for any more natural listening experience. It’s not one that I found useful, but I know that someone else might.The other mode that I have used is the aware mode. This is for when I’m in a situation where I really kind of need to hear what’s going on around me, but do not want the volume to be at its full level.Obviously, the brand speaks for itself when it comes to quality of sound. Whether I am listening to an audiobook, or on a phone call, this sound is what you would expect from Bose.As for comfort, the one negative is that they are rather large in size, but they do offer flexibility in creating a comfort fit that is right for you. It took some time for me to figure out which size adapters felt the best for me so play around with that. Even though the size is larger than I would have liked, the overall quality and Sound reduction is worth it to me.","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2024",AEQZ45LZM5AC4WOLSJHGA4MS7V3A,True,3,Color: White Smoke

I could clearly hear others talking to me. This was with the included ear tips and the SpinFits I used on my xm4s. Decided to try something new.Finally the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultras. I was so impressed that they don't really need to go in the ear to block out sound and as your environment changes, it adjusts a little here and there. I was blown away. HOWEVER, the Bose Music app is atrocious and the touch controls might as well not be there at all. To play my music I needed to start it on my phone first. With other earbuds I could tap to play whatever was last playing without touching my phone. Also, the response time on these was incredibly slow. I needed to wait a full 3-5 seconds before I could even tell if the tap actually registered on the buds so sometimes I'd pause and unpause my music on accident. It was horrible. Oh, also you can't disable touch controls on the Bose so sometimes it would pause my music because my hair or hat touched it... Very annoying.I did some research and it turns out the Sony Wf-1000xm5s are a little tricky and really require you to get just the right ear tips (I have teeny tiny ear canals but I hear people with other sizes had trouble too). Once I found the right tips through trial and error, they worked perfectly. Taps register immediately. The time it takes to play, pause, turn on ambient noise, etc. is nearly instant and it easily plays my music without touching my phone once. The other features are also fabulous but that's for a different review.I did extensive testing while I still had both buds, and I found out that while the Bose seemed like they blocked out more noise, they actually blocked, and failed to block, the exact same things the xm5s did. The only difference is the Bose created an ambient ""silence"" that tricked me into thinking it was blocking out more, but really it was just cancelling the sound of the blood in my own head. Granted that's neat, but if I want to block out chatter, shuffling noises, traffic, etc. they block out the exact same things (with a PROPER seal and correct tips on the xm5s).So besides that ambient silence and not needing to go all the way in my ear canal, the xm5s have the Bose beat in every way. I can't believe these cost more than the Sonys, given the terrible software and tap response.So to conclude, the Sony WF-1000xm5s are way better BUT you need to put in the effort to find the perfect tips for your ear shape. It's annoying, but you definitely won't regret saving some money and getting better features. I think I'd only prefer the Bose if touch control wasn't a factor or I had trouble putting things in my ears.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2024",AHPUNTPILXEUVY7J3CB3YKKQT5GQ,True,17,Color: White Smoke

I don’t like change much so I was skeptical of changing from the earbuds I have enjoyed. I found these come with 3 ear inserts and 3 ear rings (if you buy them you will see). The comfort is great. They are very light.The reason I gave 4 star is I think the overall sound is not as rich as the sound sports I had. The only other quirk is that once they come out of the charging dock, they are on 24-7. You can’t turn them off (from what I can figure out). So if I take them off and try to listen to a video or video blurb….you don’t hear anything until you put them in or dock them.Overall I do like the earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States May 14, 2024",AFHMVCLHA223OMQ6RJCU4LR2NXTA,True,0,Color: Black

But I am particular about how technology works and I hate a few things about this. 1, the earbugs are super sensitive and if you touch it at all, even unintentionally, the music will stop and it's not clear how to resume without going through your phone. 2, sometimes the earbuds won't connect to your phone and you have to put them back in the charger for a minute and try again. This means if you are ever out without the charger, the earbuds can just never connect to your phone and you can't listen to any music. This is especially true if you EVER take them out to adjust.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AFYJBV2LLFV32VBKRFFD3CJ4TSGA,True,0,Color: Black
R18L366K0CJGH0,B0CD2FSRDD,3.0 out of 5 stars Not a good AirPods Pro Alternative,Robert,3,"I keep trying to move off the Apple everything bandwagon and get frustrated that the alternative product doesn't work nearly as well. Pros using the Ultras instead of the Airpod Pros: Super comfortable, excellent fit. Phenomenal noise cancellation. The Airpod Pros come close with the noise cancellation, however, just not as comfortable. Better bass, better sound. Especially watching movies. Cons: Horrible connection problems. The Ultras drop and reconnect frequently, even while on a call. Callers can't hear me sometimes even though I hear them just fine. Ultras won't connect to another device when I need to answer a call. I have to forget the Ultras and reconnect at least once a week on multiple devices to get it working. Bluetooth says it is connected even though I hear nothing. Outside noise cancellation on a call is horrible. Nobody can hear me when I'm talking outside or driving my utility vehicle on the highway. Frequently, one bud will drop and try to reconnect. Frequently, only one bud will cancel the noise and the other will not, causing me to pull both buds out, replace them in the case, drop the Bluetooth connection and try to reconnect, having to do this several times, sometimes just giving up altogether and grabbing my AirPod Pros. The Ultras are easy to drop when you pull them out of the case. There's no easy grip so you'll use the tip of your fingers to pull them out and readjust your fingers to put them in your ears. If you're driving while doing this, you're sure to drop one and good luck grabbing the black earbud on the dark floor of a car when driving down the highway. I find myself giving up on the Ultras and grabbing my AirPod Pros more and more just because I know they will work every time with just slightly inferior sound quality and slightly inferior noise cancellation. The AirPod Pros have none of the Ultra's problems for me. Again, I really wanted the Ultras to work as well, especially for $250.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AGZBQSVO3KV4JSYV4IUVTHZNU3FQ,True,7,Color: Black

RQ56U4JBT275X,B0CD2FSRDD,4.0 out of 5 stars Wow ! I learned a huge lesson with this purchase,C and E hyb,4,"First off, I have owned many many Bose products and have always been a fan. I did buy the over ear Sony WXM4 over the Bose offerings ( ie…700) quite simply because they were just better all around and the sound was off the charts. This time around I bought the open ear Bose buds first thinking they Seoul be that much more comfortable. Comfortable, they were, but the sound was just not even close to what I expected. I then bought the Bose QC ultra buds because they had noise cancelling and the fit looked like it would avoid going inside my ear and still get the necessary seal for good Noise Cancellation and sound. I value comfort very very much and in the ear canal buds just always disappoint me. After about 5 minutes of awesome music and NC, he discomfort is more than I wish to endure. Back to my purchase here. These earbuds are the single most perfectly fitting and comfortable buds I have ever used. I could easily wear them for a full 24 hours and not even know it. The sound is very good ( much much better than the open buds) but after I started tinkering with EQ to see if I can get better sound on par with my Sony over the ear, I realized it just wasn’t going to happen. The sound with these is fantastic and noise cancelation is awesome. The comfort is best ever. To get this comfort, you do sacrifice a bit of sound quality I am afraid. Having said that, I am absolutely choosing not to even try the Sony XM5 buds because I know they will sound a bit better but at the cost of major comfort sacrifice. I am sticking with my QC ultras. They are awesome","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2024",AEQEMYMUAUD6BNNIPOSGYRWEQKMQ,True,3,Color: Black
R3ZZJGQSICX9G,B0CD2FSRDD,3.0 out of 5 stars Overall they're great but not perfect,Cameron,3,"The noise cancellation is insane. I work in a very open hot desk office space. The noise is unbearable with hundreds of employees there. With these on it sounds like people whispering across the room. My coworkers were impressed when they tried them as well.They're the most comfortable earbuds I've ever owned. They barely go into the ear. My last earbuds were Sony WF-1000XM4 and they felt like they touched my brain they went so far into the ear. They also somehow stay in better than the Sony's.The sound quality is a let down. It's no where near as good as the Sonys but everything else I like doesn't make me care.The UI/electronic side is sometimes buggy. I'm on android so it may be this. Sometimes they just don't connect, only one connects. Sometimes the noise cancellation doesn't turn on and it's stuck in passive mode that's way too loud. These problems sometimes happen, not consistently. They're significantly less buggy than the Sonys though.Phone call quality is terrible for sound quality and for the one on the other side of the call.Battery life is amazing.I'm glad I bought them but with the less than great sound quality these probably should have been $200 not $300.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AGYRTFUK7NXSIJJ5PNZU3XCXJS5Q,True,0,Color: Black
R38LAW536J73LT,B0CD2FSRDD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Impressive earbuds, but case seems flimsy",Amazon Customer,4,"FEB 5, 2024 UPDATE: I've had these earbuds now for a few months and can say without a doubt they are superior to the AirPod Pro Gen 2. In fact, it's gotten to where I rarely use the AirPods any more and use the Bose earbuds almost exclusively. For the noise cancellation (which is why I purchased these), I'd give the Bose earbuds an 8 out of 10 and I'd give the AirPods a 7 out of 10. And for the actual audio quality, I'd give the Bose earbuds a 9 out of 10 and the AirPods would probably get an 8 out of 10. The thing that puts the Bose earbuds over the top with the audio quality is the ability to change the EQ via the app; you can't do anything like that out of the box with the AirPods.If I were someone debating on buying these Bose earbuds vs. AirPod Pro Gen 2, I'd definitely suggest purchasing the Bose earbuds. But one of my first complaints about the Bose earbuds is still a concern. The charging case is just so dang flimsy. Luckily, I haven't dropped it yet but it would probably only take that one drop to mess it up. I can't exaggerate or stress this enough how fragile it is. But, that's probably why Bose sells the individual charging cases on their website for $100; they're counting on it to break.ORIGINAL REVIEW (Dec 11, 2023): I also own Apple AirPod Pro's 2nd Gen but was looking for something with slightly better noise cancellation. The Bose earbuds succeeded there, just by a little. I haven't tinkered with the EQ settings much in the Bose app, but I have noticed that the AirPod's sound a little better (at least right out of the box). Another thing is that these earbuds fit rather well. It didn't take too much effort to get a comfortable and secure fit. However, my biggest complaint so far is that the case feels flimsy and cheap. I know the case isn't why we're using earbuds, but just figured I'd point it out to everyone, especially the klutz's out there. Drop this case on pavement or concrete a few times and I wouldn't be surprised at all if it breaks.Getting back to my comparison between these and AirPod Pro's... Right now, I'd have to say it's a bit of a draw between the two.","Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2023",AE57FS42G3I6GRQZMLTQFND3RRUA,True,2,Color: White Smoke
R1LN0JEQB2AFGR,B0CD2FSRDD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Best out there, but some concerns",Mark Baum,4,"I owned some traditional Bose noise canceling headphones for years that I've used extensively for travel, mowing the lawn, etcetera. They're great! I was looking for something I could use every day, and because of my experience with the brand I purchased Bose QC Ultra Earbuds.Starting with the unboxing - Bose did a nice job with packaging, but you'd expect that in this price range. The earbud charger case is a nice shape and size, but it lacks wireless charging. This is disappointing for these high-end earbuds. The next thing I tried was removing the earbuds from the case. This is where I began to get annoyed. Perhaps there’s a trick I’m not aware of but getting the earbuds out of the case is much more difficult than it should be!The Earbuds themselves are very nice. After trying them for fit, I realized I needed to go to the larger Eartips and Stability Bands. Bose did a nice job in their manual stepping you through checking the fit and the replacement of these pieces. Once I replaced them, the earbuds are not falling out. This is especially important to me as these will mostly be used while riding my bicycle.I had already loaded the app and the earbuds connected without any fiddling on my part which was nice. I put on some of my favorite tunes and began testing the different settings; Noise Cancellation, Immersive Audio and Listening Modes. All were impressive, and each will have a place depending on the situation. Very nice!I realize this is a review of the earbuds, but the app is an important tool while using them. For example, there’s the ability to customize different combinations of the settings and setting them as favorites for quicker access. There’s also the ability to modify the default touch settings. I haven’t done this yet because I plan on living with the defaults for a while to see what might be lacking for me.Generally the app and connection is rock solid, but there was an instance where the earbuds kept loosing connection. An uninstall and reinstall of the app seemed to cure this.All in all I am happy with this purchase. Time will tell if the quality matches my original Bose headphones, but I am optomistic on that front. The only negatives I've found to date are the design of the case when extracting the earbuds, and the fact that the case doesn't include wireless charging.Hope this helped!","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AGWEER7MRNEHUTBKPVMROIOLZN7Q,True,13,Color: Black
R1FZJEA9SC5QU1,B0CD2FSRDD,3.0 out of 5 stars NEVER AGAIN! - I'm so annoyed with Bose,Amazon Customer,3,"UPDATE 7/2/2024:I am officially finished with Bose. These earbuds WILL NOT hold a charge when stored in the case. The case has never been over charged. Every single time I want to use the damn things, after I know they should be charged, they say ""battery low"". I officially finally hate them. The annoying, loud low battery warning a few hours after falling asleep with them in was enough on its own.I got these for $249 on sale in late 2023. Good, but Bose made bad choices.I waited for a very long time before getting these, due to price. I read many reviews first. I've noticed an audible faint hissing sound with the ANC. That's already kind of a bummer, but they do seal well and the active nose cancelling (ANC) works well. It's designed for constant, consistent noise rather than sudden unpredictable noise sounds (like my car travel mate's blasting 90's rock).FYI - NO ""noise cancelling"" products of any kind seem to actually fully block out car stereo when traveling as a passenger.Battery doesn't last all night to help reduce insomnia by listening to music or white noise to block out disturbances. Instead, these wake you up at 3am SAYING ""low battery"" instead of just auto shutting off, going on auto standby, or quietly just turning off. I hate electronics that talk, and I'm taking away stars for that, and may even return these due to it. People buy these precisely to NOT BE DISTURBED lol. I really wanted to rate only 2 stars because of how annoying that is, when you already deal with insomnia, but I know not everyone's the same. So 3 or 4 stars is the best I can give.I opted for these over the Sony's because I read these stay in ears better, and had glowing reviews. I'm not willing to risk losing an earpiece worth $300 because it wasn't designed to stay in place very well. No matter other issues I may have with these, at least they stay in and sound great.The case, unlike the Sony's version I read about, does not have wireless charging capability (bad choice by Bose) and they charge more slowly, I believe, without the ""fast charging"". Supposedly Bose makes a $50 additional accessory for this (which cancels the savings of buying these on sale $50 off), but when I went to look at it, it had bad reviews of what seemed like genuine customers lamenting the high price and bad quality of it. So I got a cheap silicone case cover instead, just to protect it and still don't have wireless charging.Anyway, aside from these few gripes, the sound quality produced is excellent. Very immersive. I'm not a big fan of touch controls on something so small, though. Adjusting position or hair etc, or a pet can easily end a call or change the song or volume accidentally and unpredictably. They do sit well in the ears and stay put pretty well. I only even considered this small form due to portability, but I absolutely do not approve of how small these are and how easy to drop from hand, at this price point.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023",AEOCDBTNK2A4IAM3SKMWMLKNWNFQ,True,20,Color: Black

Since that is their primary purpose, i give 4 out of 5 stars. It would have been 5 except the propeller heads in engineering and who wrote the mandatory app lack some common sense.1) These are very hard to get out of the case. Just a place to allow my fingers to grab the buds would help, since they are also very slippery. Its like they tried to have the smallest case and forgot the functionality. I have taken to looping a small rubber band around each bud to act as a lanyard. For this money, it should not be necessary.2) The case is very slippery. It’s like they had a “slipperiest plastic” contest when they chose the material. So i bought a silicone case cover for the inevitable drop on the floor.3) One cannot turn off touch controls , a la samsung. Thus you trigger actions on your phone when merely touching the buds to adjust the fit, etc. . I am constantly triggering songs and podcast restarts just by trying to push the buds in tighter. I can push the buttons on the phone instead.4) The case hinge is lightweight and closes tenuously at best. Another rubber band needed to hold it shut.5) The app is WAYYYY slower with these buds than it ever was with my prior bose qc buds. Over time, the app should get better, not worse.6) When you switch noise cancelling modes, you have to tap and hold until the change occurs. As others have said, there needs to be some indication when you have succeeded in switching modes. Instead, you end up going one mode too far or not at all because the response (rightly) lags a little.7) No wireless charging. Really?

I was hesitant about the duration of use coming from a unit that would function nonstop for 10 hour but after seeing the case was also a charging port it made things easier to use and charge faster. What does bother me is the fact that even with the alternate sizing pieces the earbuds still don’t feel as if they want to stay in my ears and that they can easily fall out. The ear tip system on the QuietComfort ear buds and QC 30 would have been a much better option for these as the flange area fits and stays in place much better over the ones that come with the QC ultra 2.

R1PPEC25MREX0X,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent solution for what they are.,Franz D. Vogl,5,"I have been using the Apple AirPods 2 for over a year. They barely stayed in my ears and if I bent down, one or both would fall out. The sound was okay but I mainly used them for conference calls. I just got the UC Ultras today. Set up was 5 min and that included getting the right ring and seal test done. I listen mostly to metal and at first, they were really bassy. A little config with the Bose app EQ as well as on my phone and they sound pretty amazing, given what they are. I tried to use them over a company ZOOM call, I usually use my Apple AirPod Gen 2's for that, but they had a hard time connecting at first and then were fine. My only grief with the BQCU's is there is no way to mute a call other than from your phone. I called into BOSE customer service and they confirmed there was no way to mute a call.Update:I have been listening to these for most of the day. I can say with all of the putzing with eq's and different music, I'd say they sound a bit ""boomy"" - bass forward. The external sound dampening I am sure crates this as well as the crossover settings to make up for a small driver. One thing I noticed is when I am listening to bass heavy music, heavy metal, the driver seems like it created a vacuum in my ear and I could feel pressure on my left ear drum. I pulled the left one out, reinserted it and it didn't happen again. Yet. Overall, I'd say the audio quality is a 7/10 - given what they are, ANC earbuds. They do sound more ""natural"" when you have the Aware setting on so you can hear external noises, but then that won't work so well on plane/bus/train. Just my $0.02Update 2.0:I purchased the Apple AirPod Pro Gen 2. Listened to them with multiple options. Different kinds of music, phone calls, and noise canceling. I do like that the Airpods are lighter and I do like that they have this active noise canceling feature that cuts the notice canceling when you are speaking. Yes, you can it turns off, but I could see it being a thing for those that sing along. Overall, I would have to say, for my listening preferences (mostly metal and action movies) I prefer the Bose. I also like that you can customize the in-ear as well as the outer stability ring. I have found that in-ear pods don't stay in very long without them and I also have the Apple AirPods Gen 2 and if I move my head at all, they just fall out of my ear, quite easily in fact. So that's refreshing to have on the BQCU's. I have an older pair of QC over-the-ear headphones, and these earbuds sound better than those do!So in conclusion, I'll be sending the AirPods Gen 2 back. I did give them a shot but for how I hear, I prefer the Bose QC Ultra's. Hope that helps anyone looking.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2023",AHPCLTW4VVI5ENFS2COV6OACD2RQ,True,20,Color: White Smoke
R22FNL5GFDSU3K,B0CD2FSRDD,4.0 out of 5 stars All in all a great product.,Amazon Customer,4,"I upgraded from the 1st generation quiet comfort earbuds. Connection to multiple devices is much better but still not as good as Apple EarPods. The fit in the ears took a lot of getting used to especially in the right ear and I think the older model was more comfortable in spite of the fact that the older ones are bigger and heavier. The touch controls are not very responsive. To change modes one is supposed to touch the left ear bud but most times I do that it just stops the music. Also so far I’ve not managed to control the volume by touch. The sound is very much the same as the older model, the noise cancellation is superb and immersive mode is really good. All in all a worthwhile upgrade. The only thing I don’t understand is that the earbuds are sold with three sizes of ear tips and stability bands and they sell other sizes separately for $10 or $15. I don’t understand why they don’t add the $10 to the price and ship the ear buds with the extra sizes (or not add the $10). It seems to me they are selling an incomplete product this way.","Reviewed in the United States March 23, 2024",AHRA5IA5OZTDIJXY2MTP2APWJMUQ,True,0,Color: Black
R29JBCX6O29JSP,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars Experience Concert in a tiny earbud,Swapnil Rupji,5,"Setting up Bose earbuds was simple as I already had the Bose Music app installed on my phone. With the earbuds in the case and case open you need to press the button on the back and the music app instantly recognizes the earbuds.Pros:1) Immersive sound is amazing in Still mode as it gives you a feeling of being in a live concert. When you move your head the sound stays in the same location. It feels like no sound is coming from the earbuds and the sound is coming from all around you.2) Noice Cancellation is excellent. There is an option to put it in aware mode if you want to hear the surrounding or off.3) You can control bass and treble however the out of the box sound was excellent and didn’t change anything.4) There are multiple eartips options for any size and shape of ear however for me the out of the box medium size was perfect. You can test whether the earbuds are the right fit from the Bose music app and it plays a test sound to check whether there is any audio leakage.5) You can group the Bose Soundbar with the earbuds and can hear the TV audio in your ears and turn the soundbar volume down. This way you can watch TV with sound muted and sound in your earbuds.6) The option to use one or both earbuds is fantastic and music pauses automatically when the earbuds are taken off. Also the controls on the earbuds are easy to use and very responsive. Tap to pause/play, double tap to move to the next song, three taps to go to the previous song, Swipe up and down for volume control and press and hold to change the mode or configure it for something else, using Bose Music App, like enabling Google assistant.7) Since it comes with charging case the earbuds are always 100% charged when in use. Just make sure that you charge the case when the LED color changes to amber.8) I made some test calls and the person at the receiving end didn’t feel a difference between direct call and earbuds. Also I could hear the voice very clearly while walking. To pickup phone call tap once and to end or decline a call double tap on the earbuds.What I wish for:1) It only supports Bluetooth connectivity and I wish there was an option to support sound over wifi (DLNA). For example if I could cast the song from my laptop to earbuds so that I am not restricted to Bluetooth range and can be anywhere in the house.2) Since its Bluetooth the earbuds are not always available in the music app and it takes a few seconds for the app to search for the earbuds and connect before you can use app to control it. Sometimes its not able to find it and you need to follow the same process as initial setup (keeping the earbuds in the case with case open and press the button on the back).","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2023",AGURXMD5HAZLH4GMSMPTCEOPF4IQ,True,15,Color: Black

R3LFF2ULC02US9,B0CD2FSRDD,3.0 out of 5 stars Has many flaws,RS,3,"I have used several headphones over the years - Sennheiser, Jabra, JayBird, Beats, Sony, SkullCandy, Bose, etc. Jabra is probably the best overall, in terms of battery life, fit, sound, wireless charging, headphone controls, and a small form factor. I have a Jabra Elite 75t and came across this ""never before immersive"" sound by Bose. I don't mind spending money for a great sound.Compared to other in-ear headphones in this market, for $300, Bose QC Ultra is bigger in size, and the charging case is heavier. Although, it does fit comfortably with the fins.The noise canceling is great. It almost completely blocks out all the noise around. But it also sometimes hurt my ears. I like the noise cancelling that I get in Jabra, and the excellent controls it offers that easily switches between ""active noise cancellation"" and ""hear through"" modes. Jabra has this ""hear through"" mode where it enhances the surrounding sounds, which is especially great inside airplanes if we need to temporarily listen to announcements while wearing the headphone. Bose doesn't offer any of these features. And the ""aware"" mode is sub-par. Absolutely not worth the $300 price tag.Also, I sometimes sleep with my headphones on. Jabra stays all night, never feels uncomfortable, and switches off when inactive for a while. Bose doesn't seem to have auto shut-off (probably it goes into an inactive mode without shutting off), it emits this continuous annoying low pitch sound. And due to its sensitive touch controls, there's no way to watch anything while lying on the side without accidentally pausing or toggling controls. Which brings to the next point, the controls. Like others mentioned, I had accidentally paused or toggled the noise cancelling modes one too many times while adjusting the volume. Just for the poor controls alone, knocking one star off. I feel, the in-ear headphones should only have physical 'push' buttons and not touch controls. ""Long touch"", ""quick touch"", ""double touch"", ""drag for volume"", etc. aren't easy to get it right every time.Coming to the sound, I would not call it the best. On some occasions, the Jabra Elite 75t sounded far better. Bose's sound seems to have a little more detail, but only sometimes. Bass is alright, not too great. Sometimes, Bose's ""immersive sound"" hurts my ears.The Bluetooth disconnects/reconnects randomly. Also, it doesn't support connecting to multiple devices at the same time. Jabra supports multi-point active connection. If I am watching a movie on my laptop, and get a phone call on my mobile, the laptop automatically pauses and the phone rings on my earphone. Bose... $300... Why not?This is an alright in-ear headphone, among the dozen others in the market. But I could not find one reason to justify the $300 price tag, especially with a lot of shortcomings that even a $100 headphone offers.","Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2023",AHSV5F4DEAX3VJFSJDAU5VFVHA4Q,True,59,Color: Black
R14URZ1KDLMBI2,B0CD2FSRDD,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound needing Functionality Help,Chris,4,"I would say that these are by far some of the best sounding headphone I’ve ever used. The noise cancellation is on point, and the different modes are immersive. They may be meant for a great musical experience, but I found podcasts and calls equally enjoyable. These buds may seem bulky at first, but the fit is perfect and they are very light, I very rarely had to make any sort of physical adjustments. Battery life has also been a huge plus, both for the buds, and the recharge on the case. There is a drawback when it comes to connecting to a PC. There is no app to control the functionality as there is with a mobile device. So, you default to the same sound mode, giving you a special audio feeling. Not so great when doing video conference calls and trying to key in on the spoken word. There is also no feedback when you touch the headphone to change settings, even a subtle beep would let the user know that something has changed. There were a few times where I had accidental touches and did not notice because there of a lack of notification or messed up even further by overcorrecting with more touches. The case, though sleek, does not have a great finish. I do not know how many times I dropped it because of how slick it is. I have yet to find an attractive or well-fitting solution for this, in forms of a cover. Having used mostly mobile phone OEM buds in the past, my experience working out, doing work items on my PC, flying in planes, all talks I’ve done with these Bose, seemed to be a bit less seamless. I gave myself adjustment time, but aside from the amazing sound, I’m finding this a downgrade to my daily routines. I shouldn’t have to think about audio modes multiple times a day, or fight with connections between multiple devices (moving from the wrong connection on the fly), or having them lose Bluetooth connection, and giving me consistent tones the one time I don’t need feedback, when I know I don’t have an media device playing.","Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2023",AHPU6W5V6C27OP5ZZ2YZRRXQL7RA,True,31,Color: Black

R1FTVJ914K4DI9,B0CD2FSRDD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great fitting, great sound options",Amy,4,"I tried the black Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds recently and have been satisfied with them thus far. They were very simple to start up, sync, and use out of the box. The instructions and app are clear and intuitive.I have used wireless earbuds in the past that don't fit well in my ears, so I was initially apprehensive, but these fit like a glove. No adjustments needed, and no signs of moving or falling out. Truly a perfect fit, and not painful or clumsy feeling at all.The sound quality is great, exactly what you would expect from a Bose premium audio offering. I have used these for audiobooks, podcasts, and music. I haven't used them for phone calls yet. The noise cancelation feature works pretty decent, depending on which mode you use. For example, the other day there were 3 helicopters circling above early in the morning and the sound was virtually drowned out in Quiet Mode.The case is sleek and well fitting, easy to use, and holds a good charge. I've used them over multiple days and have not needed to charge yet.I like that the mode offerings allow you different experiences. Quiet is the ultimate in noise cancelation. Aware is great if you are biking or running and want to be aware of sounds around you for safety but still have amazing sound quality on what you're listening to. Immersion is where you feel like the sound is surrounding you and adjusting to your position.My only complaint so far is that the earbud sensors are a little sensitive so if you accidentally hit them the sound goes out and then I end up tapping obsessively to get them back on. I've found in this case it's easier to restart from my device (phone in this case) than worry about the taps.Also, the little safety book included had print so tiny you practically need a magnifying glass.

Just used them on a plane and it was like I wasn't in a plane. Bass is impressive from such a small device. I usually run it at 60% volume and that is enough.Fit:However the key feature for me is how Bose utilized 2 different rubber pieces for fitment. The earbud portion and this ring that tucks up into the curve of your ear. The ring is what has prevented these from falling out or moving during exercise. I will never buy a pair of earbuds again that does not have this feature. Bose even includes 3 different sized rings and earbuds so you are destined to find the perfect fit. My girlfriend used mine one day and also bought a pair. She had similar reactions to it.Battery:Battery life is great which is expected from a new device. I can usually get like 11 - 12 hours out of the case. I usually only have to charge it everyother week and that gets me through 12 trips to the gym at an hour a piece.Conclusion:They are pricey but definitely worth it.

RPPZ84Y5531SN,B0CD2FSRDD,"2.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly bad, returned",haggis,2,"I own and like the original Bose Quietcomfort buds so I expected to be blown away by these. Unfortunately I was disappointed and returned these. They are smaller than the original QC buds, but not as comfortable since the interface between bud and ear does not have as much springy rubber like the original QC buds do. These are mostly hard where they touch your ear. I do like that they have adopted a ""twist to tighten"" approach which works very well on Jabra buds for instance, but the way Bose have implemented it is not perfect and overall the buds manage to be both slightly uncomfortable and at the same time, not perfectly secure feeling, like they might not stay in during a run. They aren't terrible, but they aren't perfect.They are surprisingly hard to take out of the case, the magnet that holds them in the case is too strong and they are hard to get a grip on.The packaging is pretty low-budget, which isnt a big deal to me, but is a little bit weird for such an expensive pair of headphones. The out-of-box experience is a little unpolished, for instance when setting up the buds in the app they launch into a demo of the immersive audio, but the demo was pretty loud so I pushed the volume down button on my phone, and this caused the demo to crash. Then when trying to use the Bose app to turn Immersive audio on and off, there is a huge delay and the buttons are not very responsive. This was on the latest version of both the app, and the bud firmware. Little things like that add up and make the overall experience seem kind of janky, especially for such an expensive item where my expectation is that things should pretty much be flawless at this price.The real dealbreaker for me is that the ANC is just miserable and fatiguing. I expect there to be some ""rushing wind/white noise"" in ANC buds, but these have such a loud white noise when nothing is playing that it actually is fatiguing to have the buds in with no music playing. This is a big disappointment as sometimes on a bus or plane I want to just use ANC to cancel noise, but have nothing playing so I can just have silence. There is no real silence with these buds, there is only a loud whooshing noise. The whooshing is constant even in environments that are already very quiet, where the ANC should barely be doing anything at all. My original QC buds have some whooshing from ANC but it is very quiet compared to these. Even worse, there is a noticeable electronic chirp periodically in the left bud when nothing is playing. It sounds almost like a dialup modem sound or a mosquito. There is also no real way that I could find to fully turn off the ANC, your only choices in the app are ANC, Immersive, or the mode that pipes outside noise in so you can hear what is going on around you, but I could not find a way to truly turn the ANC off.The immersive audio feature does sound pretty cool but for me it seemed like more of a novelty gimmick. I enjoyed it for about 10 minutes and then it started to feel pretty fatiguing. It almost sounds like in a car stereo when you turn the ""loudness"" setting way up, certain parts of the music get really boomy and the music just sounds super aggressively EQed. It does sound pretty cool for a few minutes but I couldn't see myself using it as a daily thing.At this super premium price, there are too many issues.","Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2023",AGXSQNHR7EVQJCONAXHVLHS74LCA,True,81,Color: Black

I hesitated for a long time buying expensive earbuds as I questioned the worth. As someone who is very immersed in music and gyms with headphones 7x a week, good sound is very important.I purchased these due to the reviews for sound quality. I almost exclusively use the immersion mode - but sometimes it is so effective it can throw off my equilibrium if lifting heavy in the gym and there is a lot of noise around that it’s blocking.The battery life was a bit of a concern for me when I purchased but with using them 7x a week for an average of x16hrs a week I can say that the battery is better than I anticipated. I will charge the case 1 time most weeks, sometimes 2 - immersion mode takes the most battery power.The comfortability of these ear buds is probably the best selling point. They are a bit bulky looking compared to some minimal sleek designs but they are so comfortable, I’ve never had a “getting used to them period” as they never irritate my ears or leave them sore if I wear them for extended periods.If I had to recommend a high quality earbud this has earned my recommendation, fully.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AF574ZBJ3NLOLCK4NZVLVJ5NOU3A,True,2,Color: White Smoke

They have some issues but Bose also does a lot right. Starting with the fit these are the best fitting earbuds I've used. They aren't the most comfortable (though they are pretty comfortable even for long periods) but when they go in my ear they stay there. Every other set of buds I've used I have to keep pushing them back in throughout the day, especially if I yawn or move around alot, with the Bose I never had to do that, not even once. The bose also do a great job of not giving you that pressure feel when these buds are in your ear. The active noise cancellation is also the best I've ever used, I work around heavy equipment that is loud at times and these buds have no issues blocking most of that out allowing me to listen to my music at low volumes. This is a huge deal to me because I hate playing music loud as it hurts my ears. Sound quality is subjective but I really like the sound profile of Bose. They aren't the most accurate sounding buds but they sound great and I can listen to them all day without listening fatigue. The only complaints I have is I wish the battery life was better, especially since the case and buds are larger than usual.

Thankfully I'd purchased an Amazon extended warranty and they refunded me the full price. Being optimistic, I immediately ordered another pair. These only lasted a little over 2 months until problems started. First, suddenly no one could hear me when answering calls. I had to switch call audio to my phone. Then, the earbud audio started cycling through the various audio modes on a continuous loop and the only way to stop it was to redock the ear buds in the charger. Finally I lost all audio on the left ear bud. Initially this was intermittent but within 2 weeks, it was full time. At the time, I was listening mainly to audio books but still it was very annoying. I contacted Bose and they are sending me another pair (within a few weeks). When they work, they are very amazing. I've had Bose headsets and various earbuds for quite a few years and never had any issues. Their sound quality for under $300 is incredible so I'll probably stick with Bose.

I now consider all of that wasted time. Until I put these in, I largely thought ""noise cancellation"" was a myth unless you counted heavy over-ear just blocking outside noise through sheer size. Not so. These are a straight-up marvel. I was sitting in a large classroom yesterday with 90+ students all talking before class started. With noise cancellation on but nothing playing, the roar was a distant muffle. With music on, I could hear absolutely nothing going on around me. Aside from the noise cancellation, these are still incredible headphones. When I'm on my motorcycle, I put them on under my helmet in active mode and they allow me to hear what's going on around me, but I can also hear my music over my straight-piped Harley, even when I'm going ""the speed limit."" The sound quality is, as you might guess by the brand, wonderful. You don't really know what you're missing listening to music on poor-quality headphones. If you love music, I really can't recommend these highly enough. I'm hearing things I never noticed before on some of my favorite songs because I've never heard them on quality headphones before. The app is whatever, you can use it to customize the long press function and find your buds if you lose them, but other than that, I don't see myself using it basically ever. The earbuds feel super secure. I put a tight full face helmet on over them and they don't move. I run on the treadmill, I train on a heavy bag, I use the rowing machine, they don't move. At no point have I ever felt like they might fall out. The only minor gripe I have is that if I'm paying upwards of $300, I'd like a little better battery life. I get just under 6 hours on a charge and if I'm on a long plane trip or whatever, I'd like to be able to use them all day without stopping to charge, but it's a minor gripe because how often are you really going to be using headphones for 6+ hours without ever taking a break?TL;DR These are amazing headphones, definitely worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2024",AGLO45QJWZQDTEXEQSGPRZQUM3YA,True,6,Color: Black
R1IGP18B0L8ROZ,B0CD2FSRDD,2.0 out of 5 stars 2 stars due to glitching,Stephanie Moreno,2,"Update: I returned them. The main reason I returned is the glitching and connectivity issues. I found myself getting angry and wanting to yeet them out the window. I LOVE the sound quality! But I couldn’t get past these issues.Original review:I previously owned the QC earbuds, the original ones. Loved them. So I naturally assume these are better….they are not, at all.Issue #1 Sound glitching. My main issue is the sound keeps glitching. I thought I could just ignore it. I’m easy to please. Nope. When im scrolling on my phone it happens more. Incredibly irritating.Issue #2 Sound quality. I hope I have a faulty pair of earbuds. The sound is subpar/weird sounding compared to the original QCs. The old ones felt more immersive. These almost sound like I’m under water. I do however, like the noise canceling. Idk how I broke the NC on my old pair but I could always hear everything regardless of having it in NC mode or not. I’m so happy I can’t hear people talking when I’m listening to music (introvert problems).Issue #3 Connectivity. While it connects fine. It’s just not as quick when switching devices. When going from my laptop to phone, I clicked on the earbuds in the bluetooth menu. It tries to connect a full cycle but fails. I click them again and they connect. Not too much of an issue for me but still annoying.Issue #4 Case, fit, and controls. I very much dislike the new case. Solely because I liked being able to look at the case and know how much battery is left. To be fair, that info is in the boss app. It’ll just take a few times of checking the app and I’d probably no longer care about the case telling me. But still something to note if you’re coming from the OGs. I do prefer the new case as it’s less bulky, however taking out the earbuds is odd. I have to pinch the rubber on the earbuds and pull up. I have no suggestion for a remedy. It’s just awkward. I’m sure with practice I’ll find a workaround. Now for the controls, I enjoy the controls much better. Both earbuds do the same thing. That’s great! The old ones, the left one changed the song and the right one paused/played. So if I only had the right one in, it got annoying. The left one, for whatever reason, didn’t work on its own. I also never looked into the issue, I just accepted it. So it very well could’ve been user error. As for fit, I prefer the fit of these. The rubber/silicone earbuds are softer. The old ones were more firm. I ALWAYS wear my earbuds. Music is the background of my life. That being said, the old ones made my ear swell at night while sleeping. I simply stopped sleeping with them in, problem solved. So on the nights I really needed music, I just dealt with a swollen ear. The material on these however, do not cause that.All-in-all, I desperately want to like these headphones. I’m going to give them a week of use and check back. If the audio keeps glitching, I will return/replace and update this review. Hopefully it’s not a product issue and I just received a defect.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2024",AG5XVPNJZ6E65XLPF5CBD52IVSEQ,True,7,Color: Black

RZNI3Q4GGG5TV,B0CD2FSRDD,3.0 out of 5 stars Only thing saving Bose now is the wing stabilizers. Wind is problem. Lower engineering quality,Brian Myers,3,"I'm pretty loyal to Bose, but the newest earbuds, while they have better quality emitted audio are of lower quality than previous products. Wind is more of a factor than it was 2 generations ago. They regularly lose the sound envelope and need to reestablish. The touch controls are much less user friendly and adjustable than 2 generations ago. The initial connectivity is less than 80%. Frequently, one has to place the earbuds back in the case, allow them to reset, and then put them back into ones ears as upon initial use one of the buds fails to activate or the sound is diminished.Since no other quality earbuds possess wings, I still prefer to use Bose, but after 2 weeks of use, I'd rather use the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds than Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. If someone else adds stabilizers beyond the silicon tips (or foam) in my ear canal, I'll probably switch.","Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2024",AHOFHJNLFZ2LRBA57YOJ67TS4M6A,True,0,Color: Moonstone Blue

I sit next to an extremely annoying coworker who loudly clears his throat all day long but with these I can't hear a thing. The immersion mode is great for anyone with misophonia. The only thing dropping these to a 3 stars is what appears to be a common connection issue -- every once in a while the right earbud will just refuse to turn on. I have to spend 5-10 minutes putting it in the case and taking it back out until it works again, which is very frustrating on brand new $250 earbuds. Had one instance where the right earbud didn't charge overnight so I'm guessing the issue is coming from the case. Currently exchanging for a new set to see if that solves the problem, but without that issue these would be a 5 all day. The Bose app is also useless as even while actively listening to the earbuds they just won't connect to the app most of the time. Sound quality is good -- nothing like my powered Sennheiser headphones but definitely don't expect that from earbuds. Comfort is great, barely feels like I have earbuds in.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2024",AEJ636WWXOINGDZTKSDXF5BC3OLQ,True,1,Color: Black

R1YDGRJOD0U8JM,B0CD2FSRDD,5.0 out of 5 stars Wow,Ray,5,"I’ll keep this review short because so many people have had the exact same experience as my own using these headphones, and all I’ll be doing is repeating long reams of written text saying just that. What I WILL say, however, is to sum this up, these are remarkably good sounding headphones that boggle the mind with their execution into little, tiny earpods. Sound quality is unbelievably good. The active noise cancellation is without doubt best-in-class. And the comfort level is better than any other earpod to the extent that you’ll find yourself trying to figure out just why they are so darn comfortable. The immersive sound works well in most cases, although it is not at all necessary to have a maximally enjoyable audio experience. Whether or not they are worth $300 is one of those imponderables, but let me say you forget about the price as soon as you start listening to them. In a time when so many products fail to live up to expectations even while costing a lot, these Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones are a breath of fresh air. These earn my top recommendation.A LITTLE MORE ON COMFORTAfter using these headphones for a number of weeks now I must come back and add a few sentences on wearing comfort. I can't explain how it is achieved, but these are without a doubt the most comfortable earbuds I have ever worn. Some say it is because of the silicone wrap that encircles part of the earbud, and that reason sounds as good as any to me, but regardless, these things are COMFORTABLE. I've fallen asleep with them in my ears a number of times at bedtime and wake up with no ear discomfort at all even after hours of wearing. The ""Ultra's"" seem a tad more comfortable than the previous-generation ""II"" earbuds (although those are very comfortable, too), and, in my opinion, noticeably more comfortable than the Technics az-80's that are currently the subject of much discussion. If you can get a pair during the holiday sales, all the better. These are astonishingly comfortable earbuds that sound wonderful and its just too bad we lose wireless charging and multi-point connection.

R2SM2MJ8U5LZR7,B0CD2FSRDD,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost Perfect,W. Dunlap,4,"The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds deliver outstanding audio quality and best-in-class noise cancellation, living up to the high standards Bose has set with its headphone lineup over the years. The sound is well-balanced with crisp highs, punchy mids, and complete bass response. The noise cancellation is exceptionally effective at blocking environmental noise, letting you immerse yourself in your music or podcasts without distraction. However, the lack of a wireless charging case is a glaring omission for earbuds at this price point in 2023. Many competitors in the wireless earbud market offer wireless charging at a similar or lower price. Convenience and portability are massive selling points for earbuds versus over-ear headphones. The option to just set the case down on a wireless charging pad instead of fumbling for a cable would make these earbuds much more accessible to live with daily. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds deliver excellent sound and noise cancellation. But the lack of a wireless charging Case prevents them from being the perfect pair of earbuds. Having to pay extra for a wireless charging case for earbuds that are already $299 is too much. If Bose releases a version with wireless charging, these would be among the best wireless earbuds you can buy. For now, they fall just short of excellence but are still a great option if sound quality is your top priority.","Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2023",AHJN5EAHKHV3H63L4NKMMTWLIHLA,True,5,Color: White Smoke

However, my Galaxy buds pro kept falling out of my ears while talking and they caused ear pain if I wore them for over an hour.Bought these Soundcore L3Ps to replace the Galaxy buds pros. Wow, at the price of $130, the L3Ps provide amazing value! Since I have the L3Ps and the Galaxy buds pros, I am going to do a comparison review.Comfort/fit:The L3Ps win hands down. Galaxy buds pro causes ear pain for me, and they fall out if I talk. I tried yawning and the L3Ps stayed in securely.Sound quality:The L3Ps has a more interesting sound profile with more bass and more treble out of the box. The Galaxy buds pros sound more neutral. The L3Ps respond to EQ much better than the Galaxy buds. I EQed the L3Ps to be more neutral, and they sound less muddy compared to the Galaxy buds. Both had impressive sound quality as Bluetooth ear buds.ANC:Both provided satisfactory ANC. Galaxy ANC seems slightly better.Battery life:Don't know yet, haven't gotten a chance to run them out of juice.With ANC off, used for 45 mins and battery went from 100% to 90%.Connection:L3Ps have multipoint connection and I love it. Galaxy buds pro doesn't have it.I noticed my L3Ps dropped connection once or twice so far. Music stops for about half a second and immediately resumes. Happened twice in a few hours so far.For some reason, my Galaxy buds pro sounded better when connected to my Android phone, but slightly worse when connected to my Macbook Pro (and the Galaxy buds were not in headset mode.) The L3Ps sounded great regardless whether I play music from my phone or Macbook.LDAC:Turning on LDAC would cause the L3Ps to lose multipoint connections. I tried LDAC mode and the improvement in sound quality is noticeable but not big enough for me to give up on multipoint connections.HearID:I preferred a more neutral sound, but the HearID ear tests made the sound even less neutral. I would say I don't like it.(Update: after trying the HearID sound for a few hours, I must say that it sounded really good! It was a unique sound profile that takes some time to get used to. Now I am surprised how good the HearID sound profile is--the more I listened to it, the more I liked it.)Other factors:I like the Galaxy buds pro's talk detection, which turns on ambient mode and lowers music volume if I start speaking--e.g., super convenient for talking to cashiers at supermarkets. L3Ps don't have this feature.The ambient mode on the Galaxy buds pro is more customizable and feels better.I don't like the Soundcore logo--the logo looked like Beats knockoff?!Quality (or feel):Both have great build quality.The Galaxy charging case feels more premium to me and is also more compact.The L3Ps have a more premium packaging.Overall, I preferred the Galaxy charging case.For me the main deciding factors are:1. Fit.2. Multipoint connection.Update: 3. The HearID sound profile might be an ""acquired taste"", and now I enjoy it a lot.These earbuds for $130 are Amazing.","Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2022",AGJBLKKCG5NXJD454D3HV43HXKPQ,True,37,Color: Midnight Black
RYZBZXQXYQZ0X,B09CGM1BWH,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Earbuds I've ever used,Alex M.,5,"I have had a couple of pairs of earbuds before getting these. They were both budget earbuds. The last pair I had were actually pretty good, but when I dropped the case, that wasn't waterproof (I don't think this case is either) in water, they wouldn't charge anymore, so I had to look for another pair.The start of my search:I tried 5 different sets of earbuds before settling on these. The first 3 sets I tried caused my pain in my ears after only a few minutes of use.Liberty 2 pro:The 4th pair I tried were the Liberty 2 pro Earbuds. Those earbuds were so far the best sounding earbuds I had used. The bass is great, which is something I find a lot of earbuds lack. I had to try out several different sizes of tips to get them to fit comfortably, but I did find a good set. Fortunately they came with a lot so I could find a good fit.I did like that the Liberty 2 Pro has buttons on the side of the earbud so you don't jam them into your when you use them, but it inevitably causes them to shift when you push the button which can affect sound quality and comfort.My main issue with them was that they protrude from my ears a lot and I was concerned that when I cut the grass and wore my ear muffs, they would get jammed into my ears. So I kept looking and saw that there was a new generation of Liberty Pro earbuds, the Liberty 3 Pros.Liberty 3 Pro:I decided to give the Liberty 3 Pros a try because they were smaller than the Liberty 2 Pros, have ANC, and touch controls. One pair I had tried before had ANC and it was a nice feature to have. These fit great straight out of the box! I think the lower profile makes them more comfortable, so I didn't need to change tips to make them fit better.They manage to improve on the GREAT sound of the Liberty 2 Pro. These are take the sound to another level. It could be because of the ANC, but I'm not sure. All I know is that they sound amazing. The ANC also sort of puts me in my own world where most background noise is blocked out and I can ignore distractions.My only issue is that touch controls aren't the most reliable. I appreciate that they are touch instead of button controls. They don't move around when you use the controls. However, the double tap feature has to be tried 2 or 3 times before it registers that I wasn't trying to single tap twice in succession rather than doing a double tap. There's also an option for triple tap, but I can't even imagine trying to get that to work. It would probably be best if you set the controls so that single tap and tap and hold are your primary functions, as those work the best.They take a little while to set up with the HearID equalizer, but it's worth taking the few minutes to get that done.Summary:If you're looking for lower profile earbuds with superior sound, great comfort, ANC, and touch controls, I wound definitely recommend these.","Reviewed in the United States December 16, 2022",AEXZCAH73UYK24NG4A5Z5PBTPOYA,True,27,Color: Midnight Black
R6ANK510E10GN,B09CGM1BWH,4.0 out of 5 stars A review two years in,N. Laquidara,4,"I've been using these almost exclusively for over two years now so I've had plenty of time getting a feel for them. First off, they sound absolutely amazing once you've found the right fit in terms of tips and earwings. I have a $120 pair of sennheiser IEMs that sound pathetic compared to what these Soundcores are capable of.Speaking of earwings, one of the most frustrating aspects of these earbuds is that the earwings become loose and begin to slip off the earbuds, which is a shame because unlike a lot of other earbuds I've tried these otherwise stay in my ears. Thus far I've had to replace the earwings once.The second flaw is actually one of Soundcore's selling points: LDAC. LDAC is a deeply flawed audio codec that is mostly marketing fluff and suffers frequent audio drop outs as the earbuds struggle to maintain it's highest bitrate and is forced to drop to it's lower bitrates. This is not seamless unfortunately and the audio cuts out as LDAC changes between it's three bitrate modes. The only real solution to this is to go into my phone's developer settings every single time I use my earbuds and force LDAC middle bitrate settings, which greatly reduces the drop outs. The drop outs don't seem to happen with the larger Soundcore Space earphones I have so this seems to be a design flaw with the earbuds which are not able to maintain the 990kbs bitrate. Using LDAC also chews through the buds battery life and I'm forced to recharge the buds after 2-2.5 hours.The quality of the ANC is pretty good but this is also battery hungry so using both it and LDAC is a bad idea. Luckily these earbuds offer decent sound isolation even with ANC off.Overall these sound great despite their shortcomings but it's a shame SoundCore has not released a PRO successor in the few years since these were introduced to improve some of the shortcomings.","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2024",AHSWLAJNHEJVT66FSFBVJXXNHMZQ,True,3,Color: Midnight Black
RV1TRA62MR76O,B09CGM1BWH,5.0 out of 5 stars audio engineer here,AircrewUp,5,"well hey, i thought this might be helpful. i have two professional headphones and have auditioned and worked with dozens over the years in a pro and personal capacity.in short, these are excellent, with a few problems... my review will sound harsh simply because i know a lot, however i would buy these again and love them, and i could mix with these no problems... most of the problems are software.disclaimer, audio engineers tend to prefer a ""flat"" response which some people might find boring. can these achieve a hyped bass and treble (""V curve"")? yes! BUT...- the HearID and some presets increase the frequencies and distort. you can clearly hear the total SPL (sound pressure level) increases, which is bad EQ design. in general if you increase a few frequencies, you should decrease others, so the overall SPL is the same- the Soundcore software does not seem to do this (or it's not working), which causes distortion in the lower (<300 Hz) frequencies- you can still fix this! just use your own EQ, and if you increase some frequencies, decrease others! done and no more distortion- the default frequency response is actually pretty flat and quite lovely. very useful if you want to use for studio / monitoring / mixing. deep and meaningful bass response- noise cancellation is great- i didn't bother using the LDAC. the default codec is fine and i can't hear any artifacting. i would be surprised if a normal human could blind A/B between the default codec and LDAC- very detailed and revealing.- some people have commented the soundstage isn't super wide. this is all ear-buds my darling (unless some software sound processing is added). they are literally right in your ear canal. the sound stage is reduced because of the way the ears process proximity information (there is none... therefore, minimum sound-stage).- you will have to be careful when mixing because the natural tendency is to add MORE reverb, which won't translate well to other speakers... you must use speaker / room emulation with these buds- the HearID... well, i have slightly reduced hearing in my left ear, which i know about. and i can see it when i run the HearID test. however, when i listen using the HearID profile, 2 things happen: 1) the bass distortion above (which is BAD), and 2) the ghost image (centre image) pulls left. therefore the EQ is not accurately compensating for me missing a few minor frequencies, and is instead amplifying too many frequencies, so it's not compensating accurately and useless. if, instead, you had hearing that simply cut off at e.g. 16Hz, they would work fine. i don't, i just have a few missing frequencies.- this is regarding HearID in general, not necessarily Anker... i question the reasoning of amplifying the low bass frequencies EVER, even if you are hard of hearing. bass frequencies are where all the energy are. they can easily cause damage, especially when you have little amplifiers and speakers sitting right in your ear. if someone tests as being hard of hearing <60 Hz, that doesn't mean you should just turn up the volume! what's a great way for them to get even more hard of hearing? doing this! people if you're hard of hearing in the bass range, find a sensible balance, don't do yourself a harm <3.- lastly, to the distortion issues... what's the other terrible thing you can do to ear drums? try and hold them in a static ""in"" or ""out"" position. this is what clipping distortion does, which is the kind of distortion introduced by raising all of the EQ spectrum without reducing overall volume. it's not good. be aware.i would suggest, do a manual EQ curve, and you will love these. use the 3D mode if the soundstage is too low. Anker has done a great job, and i continue to be a fangirl. i'm very happy with this purchase! ^_^","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2023",AGBYHJOLT3HBAS5UY222XIGVABJA,True,118,Color: Midnight Black
R1HH79A4AVER94,B09CGM1BWH,3.0 out of 5 stars Despite very “painful experience” Anker’s still #1 in for great buds! Ears bleeding from earwigs,McScruff8188,3,"I was literally sitting in the living room staring out the window waiting to test out my new soundcore liberty 3 pro earbuds because when it’s coming from Anker, you can believe that your mind will be blown away. Well, it was as I had imagined. Had a rough start. The outer box was all banged up and when I opened the box I wasn’t very pleased with what I saw. The earbuds were indeed in the box, that said there was no, zero bubble wrap or any cushioning to protect the box at all. Oddly, they were protruding halfway up the box and had an overwhelming amount of dust and debris on the packaging. I have pictures if I can find out how to upload them but that aside, the earbuds didn’t seem to be damaged so I was feeling a little better, I’ve only used them 3 times since they arrived because of the extremely painful experience with trying the ear tips and wigs. As luck would have it, I found some that had a tight seal so I was able to setup the earbuds which were as simple as snapping your finger. I listened to a wide variety of different music, watched a movie and a couple of amine episodes, not to mention trying out the app and every feature/EQ preset. I mean, it’s Anker so right out of the box the signature sound is something you can admire. You have about 20 different EQ settings for any genre or podcast you could ever want and on top of that you have more custom made EQ adjustments from Grammy award winning song writers and I found one that was the perfect harmony of mids, lows and just the right amount of bass. The 3D surround sound is mind blowing and I must admit that coming from someone who has been an Apple fanboy since the OG iPhone, and even owning every single iPhone model, size and color there are. Including AirPods, Apple Watches etc. I assure you that whenever you listen to what the soundcore liberty 3 pro has to offer, you’ll be asking yourself why you ever spent all that money for a set of Apple AirPods. I have absolutely zero to say negatively about the sound quality, ANC and ambient modes. The call quality is on par with the most elite headphones on the market for a fraction of the price. I’m sad to say that I have owned and have spent over $600 on Anker products in an 18 month span. The Anker MagSafe compatible chargers, miniature 30W charging block and I’m still using the 10ft. Braided lightning cable that I’ve had since the iPhone 13 Pro was released. But no company is perfect and I don’t think any less of Anker nor do I blame them for my 3 bad experiences with their products. The only negative feedback I have for these earbuds are that I have very strange ear canals and though I had tried every single earbud tip and the wing tip that was offered. The buds were so amazing I decided to just wing it out (no pun intended lol) to see if I could break them in. Unfortunately, not only did they not conform with my ears but they also bruised up and slightly scratched my ears and even now I’m in agonizing pain. I love music and I love Anker for producing various products that I love, enjoy and actually are keeping me somewhat sane in the current situation me and my family are having to face.. so I apologize for the long winded review. I think 3 somewhat bad or more disappointing product purchases is actually very impressive and I will still continue to purchase and endorse my friends at Anker for making such affordable yet revolutionary technology that has become a staple in my life. To the potential customers who actually have taken the time to read this review, there’s not even a sliver of a chance that you will have this experience with these amazing earbuds. I’m just one of the most unlucky people on the planet and please do give these beautiful earbuds a try and listen for yourself or you may end up regretting it down the line. I’m very limited on money and I didn’t want to spend what little I have on some no-name earbuds that talk big but never back it up. Anker soundcore liberty 3 pro is not that kind of earbud. These are among the top 3 most impressive earbuds I’ve ever owned and trust me, I’ve been through a lot of them. I give Anker my stamp of approval and if anyone knows me that’s a very difficult feat lol. I pray I can find some that I can use that will be as amazing and memorable as these are. I’m sorry to the hardworking community of Anker if I have come off as rude. I will continue to use Anker throughout my life and I hope that you won’t view me any differently because of this. That’s all I’ve got. Thank you!","Reviewed in the United States November 22, 2023",AF2RGROS4CEWHORYVTQS6HTF64EQ,True,6,
R3BKO6G91EE3T3,B09CGM1BWH,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Purchase!,Atlantis1021,5,"I just love these ear buds. I managed to lose one after only having them for a few days. I think it could be because the case bowl not stay closed if you have a silicone cover on it and carry it using a carabiner. I ended up buying g a zipper case for these, which is perfect because it will also hold the charger cord.I love that the de ear buds come with so many sizes of ear pieces and ear wings to make them fit your specific ear. They’re the only buds I’ve ever had that reliably stay in my ears where they belong. The sounds is amazing, the app is amazing. I don’t like that they don’t always stay connected to my iPhone when I take a call though. If I switch to a different screen while taking a call, they often disconnected. It is super frustrating. I love that they always reliably connect to my iPhone when I first start to use them and they also reliably connect to my computer. I love that I can have my ear buds connected to my iPhone and work computer or work phone at the same time!! Now I can listen to music or podcast from my phone with ear buds (and excellent noise cancellation) and easily answer a call from my computer or work cell phone (depending on which I have connected). Absolute game changer.I wish there were more control options, but overall they are a bargain price for a reliable set of ear buds and they don’t break the bank if you happen to need to replace them.If you lose one though, you can’t connect it to a new device. You have to have both to be able to connect to a new device. Since I lost one ear bud on my original set, I am only able to use it on my work or personal iPhones, not my laptop anymore. Still happy to be able to have it as a back up though.Also, if you drop them back into their case for like 10 min, you get an extra 4 hours of charge! And the case stays charged for what seems like forever. I rarely ever have to charge the case.","Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2023",AG645UGFZMNZ3SUMP54M3JRQLYSQ,True,7,Color: Midnight Black
R14KREK2DF11S8,B09CGM1BWH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Lots of hype, but they are really good when you customize them",Allen D. Reinecke,5,"UPDATE I:Another Firmware release has addressed the Transparency Mode to make it sound almost as if there's no buds in your ears. Not super hearing, but very natural. I now rate the Transparency mode at 9/10..UPDATE II:I finally got an email from Soundcore after a 10 day wait. However, they said had sent me two previous emails in response to my initial email and a follow-up. Someone online mentioned they had all Soundcore's email get sent to the Spam folder. I checked mine and there they were! I let Soundcore know and they admitted they were working on a solution. That seems to work OK now, at least for me. Soundcore got me new buds within 4 business days of me getting that last email and a postage paid USPS label to return the old ones for investigation. I now rate Soundcore Warranty support at 10/10..UPDATE III:SINGLE BUD USE: 7/10While I do not typically use one earbud, if you do you'll find the functionality becomes minimal. The app limits itself to just the left or right bud control customization and that's it. No ANC or Transparency modes. It sounds like the bud does go into Mono mode. The remaining customizations are to choose for the single, double, triple and tap / hold controls either Play/pause, Next, Previous Vol +/- and Voice assistant.I would have liked for ANC to be available in the remaining bud, but I understand Soundcore's logic...UPDATE IV:I found the frequency response for the L3P online and it's clear why these are so bright at the top end and need taming. Fortunately the treble reproduction is so good that you can use the response to get the excellent clarity without being too harsh. After several weeks of listening to these and comparing to other BT buds and wired IEM's I altered my EQ setting to get the best clarity and bass for all genres. I've uploaded that in place of my original. These are still the best value with the best sound, even compared with Sennheiser MTW2 and the Sony XM3 IMHO.......ORIGINAL REVIEW:TLDR warning!I’m an ‘audiophile’, but only in the sense that I ‘love’ to listen to all genres of ‘high-quality music/sound’ files with Bluetooth earbuds in a quiet, dark room and enjoy the musical arrangements as the producer intended. I also listen to music when working hard in the garden or the house! I have earbuds in my ears for hours every day.I’ve tried many TWS earbuds over the last few months and they all have their strengths and weaknesses, but none hit all the bars, whether it be fit, comfort, sound quality, app customization, retention, ANC modes, price, value for money, warranty support, etc. You always have to choose what’s most important to you and go with the buds that meet those criteria. Trouble is, everyone is different and what suits your ears and hearing may be completely the opposite for someone else. So, this review is for my ears and may be the same for you, but maybe not.I’ve had these L3P’s for over two weeks, having bought them the day they launched and having watched the overblown YT video hype released the morning of that launch. I specifically bought Prime ‘Free Return’ buds as the reviews sounded too good to be true and it was interesting that Soundcore sent out so much free product to all the reviewers. There was a clear marketing strategy in play!As it turns out, the hype was 75% true IMHO.CASE 7/10 :The sliding lid and overall case shape is a unique design but doesn’t suit my dry hands. It’s easily dropped. I also struggle with knowing which direction to slide the lid as the Soundcore logo is not intuitive to me. There is a ledge at the front of the lid, but easily missed. The earbuds also fit in an odd orientation and it takes a while to learn how best to drop them in quickly. The magnets are strong enough and I can use my fingertip on the wing to get the buds out of the case, whereas my SoundPEATS Air 3 are almost impossible to get out of their case! To me though it’s just a case. I don’t care as long as it fits in a pocket.FIT 9/10 :I’ve not used earbuds with wings before. My ear canals point upwards into my head, so stem style buds don’t work for me, unless the stems are pointed up at 11 and 1 o’clock, as I discovered with the Edifier Neobuds Pro. My button style buds, like the SoundPEATS H1, typically fit nice and deep in my ear canals with smaller tips and only touch my ears via the tips. I struggle if the design doesn’t allow for the deep insertion to lock the buds in place.The L3P is not a deep insertion design. So, the tip must seal and lock into the outer ear for me. The largest of the L3P wings aren’t actually big enough for my ears. They don’t reach the cartilage when the bud is in the attitude that Soundcore suggests. After much experience of loosening with many combos, I finally found the right combination. Actually, my ears require different combos of wing and tip left and right, but I found a smaller wing and bigger tip worked best, with the buds angled almost horizontally in my ear. Now I have a pair that is comfortable for more than 5 hours, or when the battery runs out (see below about that!). Consequently, these are probably the most comfortable buds I’ve used.TOUCH CONTROLS 9/10 :I MUST, MUST, MUST have volume control on any ear buds, but I also look for total control as a secondary requirement. These have it all, similar to the SoundPEATS products. 1 tap, 2 taps, 3 taps, tap and hold. Each earbud can be set up with whatever function you want. Also, you can disable each individually if you wish. I found adjusting the buds a lot in the early days kept changing the single tap volume I’d set up. I disabled 1-tap functionality and solved that problem!My configuration is…1-Tap: disabled2-Tap: Left Volume down, Right Volume upTap and Hold: Left ANC/Transparency/Normal mode, Right Pause/Play3-Tap: Left Previous track/Restart track, Right Next TrackThe touch controls do need some work. Once you get used to the speed of taps for multiples, the controls work almost flawlessly. I have dry hands and sometimes, the touch doesn’t register. Only 1 in 10 times maybe though. The real problem is the feedback timing… touch, volume changes, beeps sound. I’d much rather have… touch, beeps, volume change.Also, the three ANC modes are each indicated by a different tone. While you learn which is which over time, when any music is playing, it can be difficult to hear and know which tone sounded and hence which mode you selected. A voice prompt would solve that issue in a heartbeatBATTERY LIFE 6/10 :Battery life is not really an issue for me but could be for those who use their buds at work during the whole day. I haven’t checked the ANC off, LDAC off maximum battery life. I have run to almost dead with ANC/Transparency mode on, LDAC off and I got just under 6 hours. With ANC mode on and LDAC on I got under 4 hours! Considering the size of the buds, you’d think they could fit a larger capacity battery in there.APP FUNCTIONALITY/CUSTOMIZATION 10/10 :This is one of the main attractions for the L3P. You won’t get a more featured app than Sony’s, but this pretty much beats all in this price range and above. The Sennheiser Momentum TW 2 app is pretty good but doesn’t have the HearID technology or the number of EQ sliders/presets. I had BT connection issues with the MTW2 and the app. The L3P is flawless. It connects every time I open the app. Firmware updates are pretty fast (just a handful of minutes) compared with the 50 mins for the MTW2! The EQ customization capability is what saves the L3P (see below for that).What I would like to see is an option to pause music when selecting Transparency. Very often, I only need Transparency when I need to talk with someone and I have to make two ‘Tap and Hold’ actions to get there.ANC 9/10, TRANSPARENCY 6/10 (See Update above) :To my ears, the ANC is very good. Of course, the seal in your ears is absolutely critical and that gives a lot of passive noise cancellation also. Sometimes, I have to insert the buds a couple times to get the seal to work correctly. I don’t really have an issue with cabin pressure. So, the adaptive ANC isn’t needed and I like a STRONG manual ANC setting. I would say the ANC is on par with the Edifier Neobuds Pro, which claims a > 40dB reduction. Certainly, better than the SoundPEATS T2, but not as good as the Sony XM4. The sounds you hear are in the upper frequency range with few mids left. I have used these with my garden rototiller and only needed to bump up the volume by one click. For mowing though, I add my ANC Q30 over the ear headphones over the top of the L3P with ANC, so I don’t need to bump up the volume at all. I also use ANC when eating as it reduces the conducted sounds in your head! There’s no significant ANC hiss with the L3P. MY MTW2’s hissed all the time in any mode! Normal mode has a deep bass rumble, which is from inside my head. ANC eliminates that, which is why I often use it even in quiet places.I did find I got a better ANC performance using a NY street sound at full volume on my computer speakers during the HearID ANC testing. Using airplane cabin noise, brown noise or my rototiller, the resulting ANC didn’t seem as good.Transparency mode works but is still reducing the background noise. You don’t have super hearing, or even normal hearing. I tried it in my truck and Transparency muted the noise level a lot over no earbuds . It works OK for a conversation and you can hear your own voice, but just a little, but it could be better. My MTW2 sounded like I had no buds in at all.The Vocal Mode and Wind Noise Reduction options don’t seem to do much.CALL QUALITY TBD :I have yet to use these on any calls. I will update the review when I have.SOUND QUALITY - out of the box 1/10, with EQ customization 8.5/10 :Here’s where the reviewers went wrong IMHO. To be fair, some actually mentioned the highs were a little too sibilant and very subtly mentioned that app EQ customization will counter that, but most said these buds sounded awesome as-is. NO, THEY DO NOT! Out of the box, I found the sound quality was incredibly thin, sibilant in the extreme and harsh on the ears. These reminded me of the Edifier NB2 and Neobuds Pro sound profiles, but much worse. The former had no app support to adjust the sound and immediately got returned. The Neobuds could be tamed nicely, but I couldn’t get the stem style to seal reliably.I spent several days going through my 70-plus Earbud Test Tracks playlist on Amazon Music, trying to find one EQ that would work for all. Eventually I found it. It’s funny that when I went back though the Soundcore presets, I found the DEEP preset was closest to my custom EQ, though I’d bumped up the highs just a little, reduced the lows and bumped up the mids a lot. Actually, using the HearID test (which, for me, doesn’t do anything but boost the sibilant highs even more) and then adding that on top of the DEEP preset was actually close to my liking, but still too sparkly and thin. I can see it would work if you have hearing issues at particular frequencies. I’m just topped out at 14kHz and above and fine with all the others.For my ears, my custom EQ now produces a crisp, clear full sound with punchy bass. It’s a joy to listen to music with these. Vocals are still a little thinner than I’d like, but I’ve found my ears can adapt to the sound profiles of buds over several hours and I get used them. Some tracks are also ‘thin’ by design, like with many ABBA songs, so you have to choose songs accordingly when adjusting the EQ. The 6.4 kHz slider is the one that really makes the highs sound harsh.Interestingly, my Soundcore Q30 over the ear headphones also have a similar bright and thin signature sound without any EQ adjustment. Must be a Soundcore thing.Out of the box, I really like my SoundPEATS H1 as it has deep bass and great clarity. The highs could be a little more forward, but I’m waiting on an app from SoundPEATS to address that with a custom EQ. I now actually prefer the L3P, though still use my H1 for Heavy Metal, when I desire a dose of overly thumpy sub-woofer Kick Drum beat. The L3P has good bass, but the H1 has more. Volume-wise the L3P are loud enough for anyone, but perhaps not as loud as the H1. I disable Absolute volume in Developer Options to get finer control over the volume. Some songs sound better if the volume is reduced or increased by a click or two.LDAC support was added with the first firmware update. To be honest, I don’t use it. My ears can’t hear above 14kHZ anyway and I’ve tried some online tests to compare Hi Res tracks to others and like most people, I can’t distinguish the Hi Res files, other than by pure chance. The L3P still sound great without. There’s much hype relating to Hi Res and audio quality, as well as LDAC versus aptX. Go Google it. aptX is actually more beneficial to me for some strange reason. Not using LDAC does mean though that I don’t suffer the debilitating battery consumption that others might, which is a plus.WARRANTY SUPPORT 1/10 - Caveat Emptor! : (see Update above)My left earbud has a sound when in ANC/Transparency mode only, like an electrostatic clicking. It occurs when I am walking, clicking in time with my steps, or if I touch the edges of the bud then I get multiple clicks. I’ve seen others online have had the same issue. I emailed Soundcore almost two weeks ago and since with no response. I also sent a FEEDBACK message via the app – nada! Soundcore on FB said just send us an email! I’ve had Tribit and Taotronics issues and received new buds in less than a week total! There will always be issues and if the company doesn’t support you, that is going to cost you.CONCLUSION : Initially, I thought I’d be returning these as the sound and fit were intolerable out of the box. However, working with them over many days and hours, I found they can be made to sound and fit great.Yes, there’s a lot of marketing hype associated with the L3P, but fundamentally, they are excellent value for money at $170. You will not, as of right now, find a better value for features, app support and sound quality. Warranty support is debatable as of right now for me, but Amazon will come to my rescue until Jan 31, 2022, if not Soundcore!Soundcore has indeed shaken up the $150-$300 market for earbuds with the Liberty 3 Pro.I hope this LONG review helps you with your purchase decisions.Check out my Earbud test tracks playlist on Amazon Music:https://music.amazon.com/user-playlists/6c1a03929ed947ab82cc33db24d7c001sune?ref=dm_sh_I4ZRJmh4tIHTtEUHGvvCYkvPi","Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2021",AFIQPBHZIPZ2FBWIOSJYGOPAH2LA,True,329,Color: Midnight Black
R2OOIT1T5BTMXV,B09CGM1BWH,1.0 out of 5 stars Update: From Hero to Zero,Malik,1,"Alright, I feel like a tech reviewer right now so I’m going to give a detailed review on these. I never go in such detail but I have to for this one as they have been extremely hyped by many and I was looking forward to these true wireless earphones.First of all, I have been using these with my iPhone 13 Pro. This is very important to mention, because the LDAC feature on these headphones will NOT work with the iPhones.First impressions, I was blown away with the sound quality. I had used AirPods Pro, Beats Studio Buds and Galaxy Buds Pro, none of them comes close to the sound quality of these Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro. This is also due to the very well built app by Soundcore. The app is feature packed and you can customize almost everything to suit your needs. In short, these are the best sounding wireless earbuds I’ve ever used. The 3D Surround Sound mode actually works really good too, but it doesn’t feature spatial audio with head tracking.So how is the active noise canceling? If you go on Youtube you will hear that its one of the best. My experience has been a little interesting. These earbuds feature heardID and ANC test in the app which then customizes the sound and ANC according to your ears. While these are great features, I felt that ANC is actually weaker with or without these features compared to I AirPods Pro. However, the ANC is definitely good on these buds if not excellent.Coming to transparency mode. Well, it’s average. In my opinion and experience, the AirPods Pro has the best transparency mode I’ve used. I’m not saying that the transparency mode is bad, it’s definitely useable but not as great as the AirPods Pro.Now the issues…I think the first one is kind of obvious, these are big earbuds and might not be for everyone.Another thing I noticed is that the case doesn’t feel very premium and I always find myself setting up the buds properly to charge them.My biggest gripe with these buds however is the dual connection. It feels like its not very optimized. Whenever I’m connected to my iPhone and iPad or Mac or Apple TV, the sound sometimes start crackling and goes on and off which gets annoying. The process is also slow when connecting to a new device. I am not sure if this happens on Android as I only used these buds on my Apple devices only. I do think they can fix this with a firmware update.So why get these buds over the others? The buds are definitely not perfect as they do have some issues that need fixing. However, the sound quality is amazing, ANC is good and the app is just amazing. When you consider the price of these buds compared to others, its a no brainer that these are the ones to get.Overall, 4 out 5 stars!UPDATE: Taking off 1 star. The dual connection has really gotten more annoying. The sounds goes on and off like every 2-3 minutes. There have been a lot of updates, but that issue hasn’t been fixed. However, the most recent issue I’ve found is that the noise canceling automatically turns off while I’m wearing these buds and when that happens the app constantly says that it can’t find the buds although they are connected to the phone. I would also like to add that these would work far better with Android than iOS devices. As of now, I am considering to get the Beats Fit Pro as well and check if they work better for my use cases.Final update: Taking off another star. After ordering the Beats Fit Pro and comparing both, the Beats simply works better for both iOS and Android. The issues I have mentioned before on the Soundcore still exist and the most annoying thing is the voice dropouts while watching content. I haven’t had a single dropout on the Beats. The beats also fit so well and the case is far better with strong magnets. I will say the sound quality is better on the Soundcore, when it works. Also the Soundcore has wireless charging. But the issues are far too annoying for me to keep using them. In short, I regret buying the Soundcore.","Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2021",AHE5RR2SVRN4LSTKXAVVPPKWDXAA,True,36,Color: Midnight Black
R2EH8AG2M6F7F5,B09CGM1BWH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Tech is Cool, But Fit is King",Barrett Benton,5,"This review begins with the end of something else: in my case, my Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro earbuds suddenly going from stereo to mono…largely for keeps.Not fun, since I largely liked the Buds, and I'd been through pretty much every iteration of Samsung's offerings since their first (which weren't much to write home about, but isn't almost everyone's first try?). This time, though, there wasn't anything from the company to upgrade to (yet), so I took on the arduous task of seeking out an alternative set of wireless buds that could closely match the 2 Pros without searing my budget…and it turns out the answer was sitting in front of me, and on the dresser in the next room: in front of me was a pair of Soundcore Space Q45 headphones I purchased over a year back while convalescing from an accident, and helped get me through some heavy post-surgical/PT routines. For over-the-ear BT phones, they're seriously hard to beat for the price. In the next room are a pair of Soundcore PP3i wireless earbuds I got for my wife after she lost her pair of first-gen Samsung Buds (inherited from me), which she loves. That's two-for-two for Soundcore, so it seemed logical to see what they offered in their better in-ear stuff: I chose the Liberty 3 Pro.Very glad I did: while not the latest-and-greatest from Soundcore, I preferred the form-factor over something like the Liberty 4: besides not being crazy about the Apple-esque style and control layout, I felt the 3 Pro would offer a potentially better seal against the ear - a huge deal for me, since up until these buds I had yet to find earbuds that offered a proper seal for both ears, my right ear being especially troublesome. Thankfully, these buds offer a wide choice of eartips *and* ""wings"" for a stable, secure fit, which naturally makes a huge impact on sound quality and isolation from extraneous noise. And no wearing fatigue after upward of three hours' continuous wear.Sound quality is on-par with my Samsung buds, very close in terms of bass depth, with the Samsungs offering a trifle more impact but the Soundcores offering somewhat better bass definition…consider it a draw. Mid/high frequency response is very pleasant. And here's where, just as with the Q45s, I want to put heavy emphasis on Soundcore's HearID feature in their app: for me, it's crucial for getting the absolute best out of these buds in terms of sound quality, and it makes sense why - it's essentially a hearing test for creating a TRULY customized EQ based on your hearing acuity. You're not just shooting in the dark messing with sliders and hoping for the best. Yes, there's a bunch of ""canned"" presets to choose from if you'd rather cut to the chase and get on with just playing stuff, but trust me, taking the extra bit of time (not a lot) with HearID will likely be worth it.And: On top of this, for the Liberty Pro 3, there's HearID ANC - yes, not just ANC, but ANC tailored to your hearing sensitivity pretty much in the same vein as the standard HearID. I'm still playing with this function, but so far liking what I hear…or, rather, *don't* hear.Battery Life? Decidedly better than the Samsung (which is admittedly a somewhat low bar: I'm clocking somewhere between 5-6 hours, but keep in mind this is with all the bells & whistles engaged.And, speaking of bells & whistles: For me, at least, engaging LDAC is worth itSound clarity for phone calls is very good on both ends, confirmed via many calls under assorted conditions.The Case: Works as advertised. Ergonomically, I can't say it's better or worse than other cases other buds have come with - all the ones I've used came with their own minor handling quirks which I quickly adjusted to. Wired and wireless charging works without issue.In all, very good value for money, and in my case a quite stable replacement for my Samsung buds. Recommended.","Reviewed in the United States July 5, 2024",AH4Z2PSLFHDGRFG4L35LS4E2HY2A,True,0,Color: Midnight Black
R2L1J9SO6LEPWG,B09CGM1BWH,4.0 out of 5 stars Terrible quality control BUT BEST SOUND EVER when you get a working pair!,Supershopper,4,"Would be nice if I could get a pair that worked. The Liberty 3 just arrived and only the left ear bud charges/lights up in the case. So no Bluetooth signal is found and I couldn’t use them.The Liberty 4 I ordered had terrible distortion in the left ear only. I reordered and the new pair was fine.I have had earbuds by Technics, Sony and JBL and all were in perfect working condition with no defects. Why isn’t Anker overseeing the manufacturing of these? They clearly need to change to someone else as the failure rate has to be high if I got 2 out of 2 that were bad.UPDATE: I have to add the positives. After having used the Technics AZ80 ($300, they sound dead but fit is good), JBL Tune 230nc (I also like), JBL Live pro tws2 (like), Sony 1000xm5 (horrible sound and very limited app), Ear Fun Air Pro3 (ok but the on-bud controls aren’t very sure and they make a lot of mistakes), OnePlus Buds Pro 2 (no on-bud volume control!), and the Soundcore Liberty 4, I keep coming back to these for sound AND fit. They have all different combinations of fittings so you get it just right. When correctly fitted, these aren’t merely shoved into your ears, they are kind of “anchored” in so they have a tight seal and they don’t loosen or fall out. Read the fitting directions and try different combos of wings and in-ear cups. Then use a mirror to find the ridge in your ear to turn the buds so the wing goes under it - this is what anchors them in. UPDATE 3/25/2024: if yours keep falling out after they have been in a while, remove and clean off all parts with rubbing alcohol as well as cleaning the inside of your ears with alcohol. This will keep them from slipping if they start to warm up and soften the rubber tips. Always make sure that the ear tip part is fully pulled back in place on the bud because those too slip sometimes. As far as sound, Soundcores with the Hi-Def audio feature (they don’t all have this) just have that something extra - like my old 70’s Marantz receiver did/does (I still have it). A sparkle that is unique. I like good bass but also it has to sparkle on the high end and once you adjust the equalizer, you have that in spades! The other pluses that most don’t have are the unlimited custom EQ settings you can make and save separately. Technics only allows one custom EQ and you get zero sparkle even with the high end all the way up. They sound dead. The noise cancellation is the best of the brands I have used. I have a space heater running in my bedroom and when these buds kick in with no music playing, it’s complete and total silence. I thought the heater had gone off! So if you need to sleep in silence on a plane, these are your pick. You can still hear people talking some which how all of them seem to be designed. It’s supposed to cancel noise, not voices. They are fully customizable for touch controls and the touch is very sure, I don’t make mistakes when touching them. The app has everything you could want - however I wish it gave the percent charged for each bud, it just has a battery symbol to see charge. Now I do also have the Liberty 4’s and I would say they sound equally good, but since they don’t have the ear wings, they don’t stay in as well and quality control has been poor. I think they have been discontinued by Anker as of June 2024. But I do kind of like the stem squeeze controls on the Liberty 4’s. Still, best sound ever like the 3’s because they too have the Hi-Def Sound feature. Damn. You should hear what One Bourbon, One Scotch One Beer by George Thorogood sounds like playing on these while I’m writing this! See the EQ curve I am using in the picture. As stated earlier, if you receive a working pair, you will fall in love with them!UPDATE 3/25/2024 - I have been experiencing a lessening of battery life after only 3 months of occasional use. With NC on, I am getting less than an hour which is unacceptable. I have another pair that I use to sleep with sometimes with NC on, but they definitely don’t last a full 8 hours anymore, not fun to be awakened by a voice coming on while sleeping telling you your battery is low. I will be going to Anker and seeing what they can do. Luckily I have 4 pairs so if one is out of commission or battery is no good I have backups - till they start to do the same, lol. Please Anker, you have to do something about battery life and quality control!","Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2023",AGQ2IXYFGUM6KQZWTTNQ4AJ2RRTA,True,2,Color: Midnight Black
R1KD7YWRN88JGB,B09CGM1BWH,4.0 out of 5 stars Better than cheap earbuds but many problems a cheaper one wouldn't have,Godzilla,4,"I got tired of my cheaper earbuds constantly having issues like failing to connect to the charger pins or staying on in the case causing my Bluetooth connection to constantly try to route to the earbuds across the house. So I splashed out on these. They solved my main problems I had before but added their own, subtler problems.The case for these are well made and I haven't had too much problem getting them to connect, they have a slope factor that causes the earbuds to fall into place. However they still use stupid tiny pins to connect the earbuds to the case which means sometimes you have to lift and drop to get them to line up just right. There's lights in the case that pulse when they're connected and charging which is very helpful. The weirdest thing about the case is that there's a switch in the lid and if you leave it open the earbuds is still on and not charging. But it's fairly easy to get muscle memory to always close it right away and it prevents the earbuds in the case from turnimg back on unexpectedly.The low battery warning on these earbuds is a lot less problematic than others. It doesn't give incessant low battery warnings every minute like others and it's not jarringly loud or unpleasant. It gives a warning around 10 percent and then right before shutting off. It'll still wake you up if you fall asleep with them in and there's no option to turn them off but it's a step up from earbuds where you half the battery life is unusable due to nearly siren like alerts.The earbuds have this convoluted mechanic to try preventing them from falling out that straight up doesn't work unless you have the exact right ear shape. The second rubber ear piece is meant to jam into the fold of your ear rotates around the earbuds and the earbuds over time rotates itself back. So you end up needing to rerotate the thing every half hour in my experience. If you absolutely need these to stay in then get one with a proper clip.The noise canceling is surprisingly decent. I bought it despite having that feature (I don't want a mic in my earbuds) but I do find it a passable replacement for real ear protection for brief or light noise. I wouldn't chainsaw or run heavy machinery with them in but it works for vacuuming. The ""pass through"" mode doesn't really work well enough to have a conversation but it helps avoid some of that ""internal pressure"" you get with dual earbuds where you're listening to the noise of your own head.Unfortunately there's no way to change it so that noise canceling and pass through are disabled when you are using a single earbud. I'll occasionally discover my earbud's battery life is horrible because ANC got accidentally turned on and there's no clear way to tell without opening the cumbersome app. You can configure the TouchPad to enable/disable ANC but that makes it easier for it to be accidentally enabled too.The TouchPad on the earbuds sucks. You will constantly be changing some mode whenever you stretch and accidentally graze the earbuds with your arm. Or whenever you are trying to rerotate it or adjust it you'll suddenly find you paused what you're listening to. A real button would be such a better experience.Reception range is better than average but not impressively so. Battery life is mediocre but workable if you alternate earbud's. Earbuds charge quick enough to manage if you find yourself low in both as long as you don't forget to recharge the case every day or two. If the case gets low I've found that the case needs to be recharged fully before it'll recharge earbud's.App sucks for day to day use but had a couple neat options for when you first get the earbuds.The mode for connecting to multiple devices is utterly broken, you end up with unusable earbuds because they only play from one device and it's usually the wrong one. There's lots of issues around BT protocol version and it requiring all three devices being on the exact right ones... It's a mess. Google it and you'll find countless issues.The earbuds have a bug where occasionally they'll refuse to reconnect to the device you always use them with. There's no way around that besides turning the earbuds fully off which there's no method to do besides forcibly draining the batteries over the course of a full day. There's no way of knowing when it'll happen so make sure you always have backup headphones ready to go.","Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2023",AHSYXPKNEEA3FRATEHGEHR5PXHOQ,True,26,Color: Midnight Black
R3MU0FWSDZ3FBS,B09CGM1BWH,4.0 out of 5 stars DYNAMITE for music - not so much for phone calls,J. D,4,"First, let me say I have owned my share of high-end headphones over the years. I currently own a set of Sony's WH1000x-MH3s (I think they are the 3's), which are AMAZING, but I have also had Beats (buds - wired and Bluetooth), a set of wired of the legendary Sony MDR-V6 digitals (which I refuse to part with they are so good, even if I did get them in 1987 and the wires are ""sticky""). But they are cans, and sometimes I want something a bit lighter and more compact.SOUND: The Anker buds have amazing sound - full stop. The lows are solid and the highs are very crisp. The app will let you customize them nearly any way you can think of to get just the sound profile you want. Imaging is good, but not mind-blowingly good. The are comfortable to wear, and you can customize the ""buttons"" for all kinds of functions, depending on what you like.PHONE USE: The sound is good, but does not rival my Poly 5200 headset in mic quality, or functionality. I was really hoping these earbuds would take the place of both for me, but I cannot find a way to mute a call in progress without using the phone's keyboard. This is a big miss if you want this for phone / conference calls. I mean, having to have the handset right there when you are on a call, sort of defeats the purpose of wireless headsets. The Poly has a dedicated button for this, and I cannot find a way to program the Anker to do this. Maybe I have missed it somewhere, but I would suggest that Anker add a ""phone profile"" in the software, to allow this. I really wanted to just have these be my only headset, but that doesn't look like it will work for me. This may be just me.... and the sound is completely passable and they may be fine for you. If they were to fix this, I would upgrade my review to 5 stars. If you aren't going to use these for phone use, buy them. Like now.BATTERY: I haven't used these for extended periods yet, but I have yet to charge the base - in about a week. So, I think the battery life is just fine.FIT / FUNCTION: If you can't find a combination of the silicone adapters to make these buds fit your ears well, I'd be pretty surprised - they come with a *pile* of them. as far as function goes, the only gripe I have is it can be a bit challenging to get the bud out of the case. Putting them in is great as they have a magnet that snaps them into place. Now, this also means that they won't fall out inadvertently, which is a good thing. I find myself grabbing the silicone, which is concerning as eventually these will wear and fail, I fear. It might be useful for Anker to make a slightly larger mark on them to tell which is right / left. There is a mark, but it's tiny. I'm sure over time, it will become second nature.ANC: The only ANC headphones I have and can compare to are the Sony's 1000's, which isn't a fair comparison, as they are full cans. They were also like $275 when I bought them, vs <$100 for the Anker's. The Anker's ANC probably drowns out 75% of the background noise, if you have any music playing. Example: I am listening to music right now while typing this on a full mechanical keyboard. Between tracks I can hear my typing, but not when music is playing. If you don't have music playing, it's maybe 50% noise cancelling. So, these aren't going to beat something like a full set of cans, but overall, I am happy with it. I'll be taking them on vacation next week, and that will be the real test of the ANC.VALUE: Simply put, these are just insanely good headphones for the money. I got them on sale, thinking, ""well, I'll try them, if they don't perform, I'll return them."". I am definitely not returning them. Even at regular price these are an excellent value, and I'd buy them again.OVERALL: Great sound quality, good ANC, and a tremendous value for money. Buy them, I doubt you'll be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2023",AFFLOZQTK4WDUUK4GEXLNBTBFUPQ,True,41,Color: Midnight Black
R3N5VPY6UXTDDF,B09CGM1BWH,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great in some ways, not in others",NC Fan,3,"I've been using these as my only ear buds for the past 6 months. I use them on average 2 hours a day; sometimes for 4 hours or more. There are some features that are worth considering on these earbuds, and some things that make me want to purchase another brand.SoundThese earbuds sound great. The bass is strong when it needs to be, but not overwhelming at all. I listen to jazz, funk, and pop/rock from the 70s and 80s. The HearID Sound Test within the app customizes the equalizer separately for each ear and the resulting sound is much better for me than the default sound profile. In the past I've used Pixel Buds (the original, not the Pro), Pixel Buds A, and Sony Linkbuds. Anker sounds better than any of those, in my opinion.Phone CallsI make a few phone calls every day on my earbuds and one of the reasons I selected these is for their phone call quality. I often make calls using these buds while driving. Some of the people I talk with will not hesitate to tell me if my voice quality sucks (they have said so with other devices). No one has ever complained about voice quality using the Soundcore 3 Pro buds. My voice is always clear, even when I am in noisy environments. These buds outperform much more expensive buds like the Sony MX4 and Boise Quiet Comfort buds for phone calls in noisy environments, at least according to the Youtube reviews I've seen. The higher end buds don't focus on phone calls as much, apparently.ANCThis is the first ANC capable device I have used, but it seems to work well for me. It blocks much, but not all, outside noise. I have flown with these earbuds and find that I am more relaxed on the plane. I guess the jet engine noise causes me low-level anxiety which I was unaware of. On a long drive with my two adult sons, I eventually needed a break from their music. I put in my buds with ANC on and found peace. It was wonderful.Touch ControlsThe touch controls are one of the most disappointing features, especially after using two models of Google Pixel buds. It often doesn't pick up on my touches. I can customize the touches, but the customization only works when I have both buds in. When I'm using only one bud, which I often do when listening to podcasts, the touch controls revert back to the default, which is annoying. Also, when I take a bud out of my ear, it is supposed to stop the music. It does for a second, but if I'm holding my bud in my hand, it thinks it's back in my ear. When I'm on a walk and stop to talk to a neighbor, I would like to remove one bud and have a conversation. But the music starts again soon after in the other ear.CaseThe case serves its purpose, but I have a very difficult time getting my average-sized (male) fingers in to pull out the earbuds. More on that later.Ear WingsThis is my other big frustration with these buds. Over time, the ear wings get loose and start to slide around, not staying put on the earbud, making for a poor fit. No other manufacturer that I am aware of uses ear wings. They are not a plus. I've found on the Soundcore website where I can order replacement ear wings, but it says they are sold out. I'm currently using the next larger size, which decreases comfort.I think one of the reasons I have problems with the ear wings is that I can't get my fingers into the case to grab the buds. I end up grabbing an ear wing instead. I usually grab the right bud first, and the ear wing on that earbud is very loose (the left one doesn't slip around near as much). Once I get the right bud out of the case, it's easier to get the left one out without having to grab the ear wing. If you purchase these, I suggest you stick your finger between the buds in the case and 'push' them out rather than trying to grab them. I believe it will allow the ear wings to last longer.BatteryI've almost never run low on battery for the buds. Wearing them 2 to 4 hours at a time, they have plenty of battery.Software AppThe app on my Android phone works well. There are some features that are confusing or hard to find, but overall it's a good app. You can take the custom sound profile it creates for you and alter it (more bass, different music styles, etc), but that function is not intuitive to find in the app.Overall, a great pair of ear buds. If I could get replacement ear wings, I would be a lot happier. If I can't, I may need to purchase another brand.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2022",AHU56CP2K2PYV6NHXBYNVK7WMHMQ,True,58,Color: Midnight Black
R28WSM18SAL3AD,B09CGM1BWH,5.0 out of 5 stars Hands down best buds at this pricepoint,J. Bijak,5,"First off, I'm not an audiophile but I do enjoy a pleasant, full and vibrant sound when listening to music. Most of the time, I'm listening to music through my klipsch computer speakers, definitive/denon home theater or harmon system in my car. For an upcoming trip, I was looking to pack light and leave the QC 35's behind so I started on a search to find a light, comfortable and good sounding TWS buds without breaking the bank.I first purchased a sub- $50 pair of well reviewed buds from a no-name brand. They were fine for the money, but have a very thick bassy and muddy sound profile and were not a good fit for my ear shape as after a few minutes of wearing, you could feel them slipping out - returned.Next up, I decided to try out the liberty air 2 pro's as they struck a good balance of price/performance. These were leaps and bounds better than the no-namers, with less bass, but a more balanced sound and some great features like ANC, transparency mode and a fantastic app from soundcore with great customization. I popped them in my ears and game over, this was the set. Unfortunately due to the thick body of the bud itself, they caused significant discomfort on my outer ear after 10 minutes and as much as I enjoyed the sound, they were unfortunately too uncomfortable to wear. So back to the drawing board.I was hesitant to purchase the liberty 3 for a few reasons. First off, the design made these look bulky, awkward and I didn't want something protruding out of my head. I was also worried about the fit, since they looked much wider than the air 2 pro's which were uncomfortable in the first place. And finally, I just couldn't imagine the 3's being worth the extra cost and the hype... Boy was I wrong.So here is my review. First of all, these sit much deeper in the ears than the air 2 pro's which create a better seal and noise isolation. Additionally the design and fit of these is superb. They sit up a bit higher and don't create pressure on the lower outer ear making them very comfortable for extended listening sessions. They are much easier to put in your ear's without fiddling too much to get a good, comfortable fit compared to the air 2 pro. Lastly, profile is good, they do not stick out or protrude out of your ears.I wont go into the app and customization, but if you know soundcore or watched any videos, you already know that it is superb and will be hard pressed to find better app support.And finally... the audio quality. Its hard to describe sound, as we all define it differently but I will do my best. First off, yes, these sound significantly better than the liberty 2 air with a wider soundstage, crisper highs and smoother bass. And for sound quality alone, they are absolutely worth the extra $$. The sound is not muddy, heavy or tinny but offers good separation and a great balance across the spectrum. I compared these side by side to my bose QC35's which are my daily drivers and I may actually enjoy the presence in these a bit more. The liberty 3's have more bass, crisper highs but offer a very different mid tone experience. The bose feel warmer and smoother, almost like the sound hugs your head whereas the liberty's feel wider and sharper. All in all, these sound incredible, fit very well and offer some great features at this price point. Could I spend a bit more and try the sony, sennheiser or bose? Sure, but there is no reason, as these are just a joy to listen to.The only con I can think of is the case. Its small and compact, certainly premium in feel but the way the buds fit into it is a bit awkward and finicky. I think the unique shape of these make it a bit more challenging to line up with the charging magnets.TLDR: Fantastic sound quality, easily a huge improvement over the liberty 2 series. Great comfort and fit and an incredible value for the money.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2022",AFCCZIZ7BOBMGBKAAVI2OJ6L4VRQ,True,33,Color: Midnight Black
R3LMAGEFHCLVDP,B09CGM1BWH,3.0 out of 5 stars Not worthy as replacement for the Life A1 as workout earbud,Adriano H.,3,"As mentioned, I am trying the Liberty 3 Pro as possible upgrade to my current Soundcore Life A1. My primary use is for working out/exercising (strength training, treadmills, jogging, biking, etc.). I've been watching the L3P for a while and got it at a discounted price during Black Friday.So comparing the L3P to the A1:SOUND QUALITY: the L3P has a noticeable better sound quality than the A1 right out of the box. It has a lot of sound presets via the mobile app and you can customize your own EQ as well as ANC (active noise cancelling). That does not mean the A1 has bad sound quality though. Once you start listening to music you just get used to it. You will only really notice the quality difference if switching back and forth from one to another.SOUND VOLUME: the A1 seems to be louder than the L3P. Ex: I'd need to change the Spotify normalization setting to LOUD for the L3P to match the A1 max volume, but that would compromise sound quality so it wouldn't make sense and we don't want to go deaf anyways. In any case, the L3P is loud enough... it's just something I've noticed.CONTROLS/BUTTONS: the L3P has touch sensitive ""buttons"" while the A1 has physical buttons. My first workout test was running on the treadmill at the gym and while the L3P is easier to tap, it is also very prone to accidental taps. I've had multiple accidental single-taps (changes volume) while wiping sweat with a hand towel during the workout and even had a couple of accidental double-taps (skips/pauses) as well. That does not happen with the A1 since it has physical buttons that need to be actually pressed. I give the A1 a win on this aspect.SIZE/FIT: the L3P is a little smaller than the A1 even with the largest ""earwings"" and ""eartips"" but stayed secure on my ears during exercise. I specifically need earbuds with earwings because other models without them don't really stay put on my ears (everyone has different ear shapes!). I could never wear the Samsung Buds for example.NOISE (CANCELLATION): The L3P have ANC while the A1 does not, but still, the L3Ps are earbuds (as opposed to full around-the-ears headsets) and the ANC is less than perfect and you can still hear background noise. The A1 does not have ANC but due to it's size being a little bigger, it fits a little more snug on my ears and the ""passive"" sound isolation is still good (more on this in the next point).SHAPE/WIND NOISE: The second test was a bike ride and right away I've noticed that the L3P is very susceptible to wind noise due to it's shape, kind like a little mushroom sticking out of the ear, while the A1 is very aerodynamic and sits almost entirely hidden in the external ear canal. The L3P shape together with the smaller size and slight loose fit compared to the A1 makes it very noisy in windy situations. I actually had to pull over and go on the phone app to turn on the ANC and there is even a toggle to ""reduce wind speed"" so I guess this lack of aerodynamics was a known factor for the L3P. That was a big surprise to me since I never had, or at least had not noticed, wind noise issues with the A1. So my ~2hr bike ride with ANC on drained about 40% of the battery, in line with the estimated ~5hrs total duration with ANC on which would be ok for me but not for an all-day-use situation. The A1 is estimated to last ~6-7hrs on a single charge so, for my particular use case, the A1 is also a winner here.MIC: I didn't test the mic quality myself but I saw other review videos and the L3P definitely has better mic quality for anyone using it for calls. I rarely ever use the A1 for calls but I know it works ok from the few times it happened.In conclusion, for my particular use case as workout/exercise earbuds, I'm sticking to the A1 mostly because of the touch sensitivity and wind noise issue of the L3P. If I was using earbuds mostly at home or office, or a somewhat noisy environment/situation that required ANC, I think I'd keep the L3P. Keep in mind all of these factors can be different from person to person because of ear shapes.","Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2023",AHD6MBJJHL3L4OJ7R3F4AVZ5T74A,True,10,Color: Midnight Black
R2MRZ2CH2KRF6,B09CGM1BWH,4.0 out of 5 stars They keep falling out,Kit,4,"I honestly don't know how to fix them falling out of my ear and I've tried everything. I used the small, medium and large ear tips but all of them keep leading to them falling out of my ear. I started off with using the large as that's what I use for the two other pair of ear buds I use, however they kept falling out so I decided to test the medium and small as a last ditch effort but both were worse. I then used the different wings they came with but they only kind of help. With the largest wing and ear tip they squeeze out a little bit but mostly stay in, so I only notice it in loud areas and thankfully it doesn't effect the sound quality a noticeable amount. Moving on to sound quality, these are by far the best sounding tws ear buds I have ever tried and the noise canceling is the icing on the cake. If it weren't for me having to push them back in every now and then, these would be a 100% recommend to everyone who doesn't want to spend $200 for the top of the line earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2024",AERN57C3NFEDCXUEORU2KYD6MCEA,True,1,Color: Midnight Black

They fail to properly switch between running Stereo and Mono audio. Very sad to see but workable.On Apple phones you can switch the audio to Mono through accessibility, and then to Audio and Visuals. A pain to change when you want to only run one or two earbuds.The second being the lack of a “Find me” feature or locator feature. Kind of like what JBL or Skullcandy does. Just a fairly pitched tone that is easy to hear and find. Sucks the app didn’t include this feature.Besides that, the whole product is extremely high quality and the sound is clear with bass even. I highly recommend these, especially on sale. But even when they are regularly priced, it is really nice and worth it.One last thing, the case includes little LEDs which I really like and it’s easy to see if one is missing or you want to grab them at night.9/10 would be willing to buy again and would be a full 10/10 if only there was the working switching between Stereo and Mono along with a Find Me feature.","Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2024",AH7ZOH546DQE6VWMBKBH5O2XSIHQ,True,0,Color: Midnight Black

I wanted a nice sounding pair of buds, because I work as a welder, so I can't wear over the ear style because of my hood.. I wanted a seal type to double as light duty ear plugs, but also have the transparency mode for conversion with engineers when they come down. I'm the kind of person who pays meticulous attention to things I use, so if you're reading this, Ill do my best to be fair and descriptive.Case: simply put; don't like it. The texture is very smooth and I constantly worry I'm gonna drop it.. And because of the slide style it uses to open, I have yet to find a decent cover case. Putting the ear buds back in is kind of frustrating too.. They might snap into their area, but pay attention closely, because often they don't get good contact to charge... This had happened to me several times.. Even after I made sure they were in with contact, apparently from bouncing around in my bag, they lost contact somehow... To have a fully charged right and dead left is annoying AF... Like the way it looks and the style points, but as a whole, could be way better...Fitting: there are so many options.. I spent weeks trying on size 1, wing 3, size 2 wing 2, and even mix matched sides to try and find the 'best fit': in fact I just am trying a new combo today.. So you'll have plenty of time to try and figure out your goldilocks combination.. It was kind of annoying, because you can't make a choice on the tip/wing based on 20 minutes of wearing them, especially if you intend to wear them for hours at a time. However, I respect soundcore for all these options, and for that I give them the thumbs up as opposed to just giving 3 ear tips; they want you to find that comfy fit, and the effort does not go unnoticed.Sound: at first they sounded a little low on bass for my tastes, but between finding the right tip and using the app, I have found an excellent sound profile that I truly enjoy. I listen to songs I've heard thousands of times, and still occasionally go ""wait.. Never heard THAT tiny detail before."" in short, put in the time to get a good fit, run their soundcore sound profile test, and bam, you got some kicka## buds for the price point. You won't get good sound without a good seal, and I was surprised to realize that the size I thought I would use, wasn't the size I 'should' use. Also, when removing the buds, do a twisting pull out method. Pulling straight out will end in the silicone tips being flipped out.App: the app alone is partly why I wanted to hold onto these as opposed to returning them. Great app. It's been getting updates, so it's great to know they didn't just toss out some half baked app and forget about it.. It's truly great. Use it to fully optimize your listening experience, and you will be rewarded handsomely.Connection: yes, occasionally there's a hiccup in the connection, but I've had that happen with my 50 dollar buds too, so I don't think it's these buds specifically. Plus, the app just updated the firmware and specifically said 'fixed connection issues'. So once again, nice to see continued support from soundcore.Overall: great headphones for the price. Some goods, some bads. Buy em, try em for yourself, that's the only way you'll truly find out.","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2022",AEVLJFVYCHMTQKYNA2EQERB7JAZQ,True,7,
R2YQR97KAWW2J7,B09CGM1BWH,3.0 out of 5 stars Almost great,Paul Ferraro,3,"Overall, these earbuds are very good and feature rich for the price, assuming you can get them on sale.Positives:* The build quality of the earbuds is impressive for this price point. The case itself is far less ""premium"" feeling, especially compared to the earbuds themselves.* I love how easy it is to swap ear tips. They are notched to ensure a specific attachment depth, which ensures that the frequency response remains relatively consistent when swapping out ear tips.* I like that these earbuds have ear wings. They definitely help the earbuds feel more secure and encourage the ear tips to retain their seal. There 3 alternative size options: 2 smaller and 1 much larger option. I do wish there was a 5th size option, midway between the largest and the default size. The execution of the ear wings themselves is not great though, see below.* The ANC is surprisingly decent for this price-point. Don't expect any miracles, but it does made a substantial difference over the passive noise cancellation provided by the ear tips alone. I was surprised to find that enabling ANC noticeably alleviates the sensation of having your ears plugged by the ear tips.* Transparency mode works better than expected for this price point, and has a ""voices only"" mode* ANC has a ""wind"" mode, which helps (but does not completely eliminate) wind noise, which is otherwise exacerbated by ANC.* The earbuds are capable of HD streaming via LDAC, though this needs to be explicitly enabled via a specific firmware version available through the Soundcore app. Unfortunately, this is also a negative, see below.* The default battery life is excellent, so long as you do not enable LDAC, see below.* Once drained, the earbuds recharge very quickly.* Soundcore actively maintains its app and device firmwareNegatives, but with workarounds:* The default touch controls are not very intuitive. Fortunately, the app allows you to completely customize them, allowing different controls for each side, as well as enable single and triple tap gestures, which are disabled by default.* The default tuning (i.e. frequency response) is very V shaped, and not my ideal. In general, the bass is very impressive with good extension, but is overly emphasized, while the treble has some harsh peaks. Thankfully, an AutoEQ profile for these earbuds exists (via the Wavelet app on Android devices), which successfully tames the tuning to align with the Harmon curve. Once the AutoEQ convolution is applied, these earbuds sound really nice.Negatives:* The ear wings have an annoying tendency to slide out of place once you twist the earbuds into your ears (as instructed). I do wish these would snap into (and stay in) place the way that the ear tips do. The worse side-effect is that once the ear wings slide out of place, they will cover up the wearing sensor, which can cause music to auto-play. The only workaround I have found is to completely disable wear detection. Additionally, I find that I need to readjust the ear wings after every use, otherwise the earbuds will not fit back into the case.* The latency, while not terrible, is too high to comfortably watch videos or play games. Frankly, I do not understand why so few TWS manufacturers support AptX Adaptive, since most already rely on Qualcomm chips for bluetooth.* When streaming music via LDAC, my sound cuts out far too frequently (at least every 5 minutes), even though my source device is nearby and unobstructed. While the situation might improve with future firmware updates, the fact that this issue is still so problematic in 2022, even though these earbuds were released in 2021, is very concerning.* Some features (e.g. multipoint) are not available when using LDAC.* Using LDAC burns through the battery very quickly, especially when used in conjunction with ANC or transparency mode. On a full charge, I was only able to play music at a normal volume for 2 hours before receiving the ""battery low"" notification. This is very disappointing, given that these earbuds advertise 8 hours of battery life on a single change with ANC off and 6 hours with ANC on.In summary, there is a lot to love about these earbuds, but, for me at least, the issues with the ear wings and LDAC implementation are insurmountable. Hopefully, Soundcore's next generation earbuds will solve these issues.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2022",AGKIDBUJ2WM52CU5DMZ64WVZSTNA,True,8,Color: Midnight Black
R1SJQ9HKUYWD6Y,B09CGM1BWH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Coming from the liberty 2 pro, these are awesome",Brian,5,"I've ran through 4 sets of liberty 2 pros at this point, if I hadn't lost all of them, I'd still be using em but after a toilet mishap, it was time for me to get a new pair. I've been commuting often now and the one thing that the liberty 2 pros lacked was active noise cancelation so even though sound isolation was pretty good in the liberty 2 pros, it could have been better. I haven't tested the liberty 3 pros ANC in a commute stress test yet but I will update when I do.Sound quality compared to the liberty 2 pro's is an all around improvement. Testing them both under the same personal eq, the liberty 3 pros have almost all the same characteristics as the liberty 2 pros but bass is noticeably punchier with bass drum hits becoming more pronounced even in bass heavy songs ex) knife talk - drake. dB levels of bass response when the 2 are put side to side clearly shows the liberty 2 pros being louder but when listening to them, the liberty 2 pros exceptional bass response causes the overall sound to become muddy and ruins the sound stage. The mid response on the liberty 3 pros is several dB higher than the the liberty 2 pros and is the category that I need to adjust my eq on. Treble is sharper on the liberty 2 pros to the point that it's a little painful. The liberty 3 pros tone down the treble in this department to a very comfortable level but still clearly present, just not knives in your ears.Ergonomicly, the 3 pros are more slippery than the 2 pros simply because theres less surface are to hold onto as well as the new slippery finish of the 3pros. The liberty 3 pros fit the same as the liberty 2 pros but don't have the extra large ear lobe loops that the 2s have. The liberty 2 pros button control has now been replaced by a touch sensor. For my purposes, I only use the buttons to pause and skip songs so I don't lose any capabilities but for people who have all 3 button configurations programmed will find that the single tap feature on the 3 pros will constantly be accidentally pressed. Both the 2pros and 3pros cases are functionally the same with the 3pros being slightly smaller and looking slightly sleeker in design. The 3pro retains the wireless charging capability that the older generation had.Pros and cons of the liberty 3 pro vs liberty 2 pro:+ active noise cancelation+ punchier more accurate bass+ similar eq characteristics to the liberty 2 pro+ longer battery life+ smaller carrying case+ better anesthetics+ retains wireless charging function- touch control in favor of button control- bass dB response not as high as previous gen- slippery finish may cause you to lose earbudUPDATE:Tested ANC in commuter setting. I can't compare ANC to any other devices as this is my first experience with it. After firmware update, ANC has low med & high settings. Low and med block out sounds without much of the pressure feeling on your ears. High setting actually let's me hear the bass notes clearly and I can lower the music 1 or 2 notches. Battery life with ANC enabled is approximately 5 hours.","Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2023",AFTXAWV3CN3QQLOD5PQA7VTMP26A,True,20,Color: Midnight Black
R2HXGESVBZLSOE,B09CGM1BWH,4.0 out of 5 stars Buds lack a few coveted features like talking to me and Microphone Mute. I need a unicorn!,Nicole L.,4,"I've been looking for earbuds to replace my amazing Jabra 65t. I loved these so much I bought two pairs 3 years or so ago but was looking for something updated with some more features. Plus after 6+ hours of wear they start to hurt my ears.So on the hunt, I was looking for these features:* Multipoint ✔* Wireless Charging ✔* Alexa built in (Liberty Pro 3 allows Siri configured on App)* 8 microphones (Liberty Pro 3 has 6)* Mute Button on earbud (not available)* Talk to me! (Liberty Pro 3 doesn't announce who's calling)Noise-canceling wasn't top on my list but most good earbuds have this feature. Most do not have Multipoint so this narrows down the field considerably. Most also do not have 8 microphones but the reason I wanted this was because I use these primarily for music and conference calls in the car. I needed some big time noise canceling microphones (not headphones, microphones!).Multipoint: I connected the Liberty Pro 3 to my computer and phone. Pairs well with the phone but does not automatically default with the PC like my Jabras did. I have to select the earbuds on Audio.6 microphones: As a listener the sound quality is excellent even in a noisy environment. In a noisy environment, the receiver can hear me speaking clearly, but the outside noise is still a factor. Even me walking around the house is noisy for the receiver.Mute button: Without a mute button, conference calls while doing other things is a hassle (my Jabra didn't have this either though)Talk to me: My Jabra's would say ""Connected"" and ""Two devices connected"" and ""Call from..."". Liberty Pro 3 doesn't talk to me :( it beeps at me in different tones. I did not even think of this as a ""feature"" and I am hard pressed to find reviews of earbuds mentioning this. I also have a wired set of Jaybird Tarahs and even they talk to me. I guess it's one of those things you don't miss til you don't have it anymore.Pairing/Drops: I was paired to my phone and PC listening to music. A Zoom call came in and earbuds switched over correctly and I was now in a meeting. Then I got a phone call while I was on Zoom. I hung up on my phone and then the earbuds went back to music rather than my Zoom call. I have had a couple ""skips"" and not drops which never happened with my Jabras. Sometimes one of the two earbuds cuts out.Comfort: A lot more comfortable with long wearTouch controls: A little too touchy since I enabled one tap for Siri, it opens Siri all the time when I move my hair or put the buds back in the case.Case: Nice, easy charging. I like the slide case. This is pretty minor but you have to take the buds out of the case and turn them over before putting them in your ear. I like to grab and go quickly especially if I'm getting a phone call. The Jabras were a lot more intuitive in that respect.All in all, I think I will return in favor of a closer unicorn, the Jabra Elite Pro 7. I'm super curious about the MultiSensor Voice bone conduction.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2022",AFMDZAHCRJZ3YEIX22UD2JWXZBTQ,True,2,
R18UJB14KMKBVR,B09CGM1BWH,5.0 out of 5 stars Had an issue and Anker handled it perfectly,Ray Wodanson,5,"I seem to be a twe, true wireless earbuds, fanatic. I have over the years spent thousands of dollars on different earbuds, I have done several Kickstarters ps don't do Kickstarters for earbuds it never works out well, I have bought high-end, lowend, and midrange earbuds. Prior to my issue with the charging case with the Anker Soundcore Liberty pro 3 they were one of the best earbuds I have ever used. Now after dealing with their customer service I will say they are the best earbuds, or audio company at the least, I have ever dealt with. My charging case stopped taking a charge so I was unable to use the earbuds, within days of my contacting Soundcore customer service they had sent out a replacement unit, full unboxed set or earbuds, wingtips, ear tips and paperwork. Have never been so satisfied with a companies commitment to their product before. So I use these earbuds everyday, pretty much all day. I am on the road and don't have Bluetooth on my trucks radio so it's either listen to radio or Bluetooth earbuds/headsets. With the anc turned off I get 8 hours if not more. With anc it runs about 4-6 hours which isn't bad. The sound quality is phenomenal, nearly as good as my $300 Sony's but at half the cost and almost doubled the battery life. I have used the app to both train the anc and the equalizer to work best for me. Even if that is all smoke and mirrors it makes it feel as if the sound is better.","Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2024",AFHO24XRVACIL53CPHNKDBX4GNUA,True,0,Color: Midnight Black
RXPMESR1B1ONI,B09CGM1BWH,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect,Young,4,"I work as a mechanic and needed something to replace my trusty Samsung Buds+ after they took a bath in oil. After searching around these were the answer, though I hadn't heard of Soundcore before the brand certainly delivered. My bay neighbor has a Motion Boom speaker and the quality of the sound and the volume it produces is insane! Now if only he could play something besides country music all day. Which is where these earbuds come in. Out of the box, its nothing too special, though it definitely is better than most. The real magic is when you start to use the app. The ANC is very nice, definitely keeps the shop noise to next to nothing besides maybe the odd tick of the industrial AC blower from time to time, and when I take off the buds its feels like being hit by a dubstep concert by how loud the shop actually is. Normal mode is fine, the silicone tips do a fine job on their own at noise reduction. Transparency mode is okay, though I do find that I can hear people just fine if I just stop my music while using ANC. The controls are fully customizable though I only use the left earpod for music control and the right for volume control. I wish there was a way to disable switching modes through the buds, but its not the end of the world. They also have a mapping mode in the app that maps out your hearing space (I think that's what its called, I work on cars, not ears lol) and using that really makes the sound stand out over other buds.The major downside to these buds is really no fault of their own, I don't think any other buds can improve on them at this stage in the game, is the fact that the battery life while using LDAC is pitiful. I can maybe get 2.5 hours out of them before needing to charge them up again, which is a plus to the buds, it will go from zero to full in only 30 minutes but each day I do find myself needing to charge them up 3 times during my 10 hour shift. The case battery life is actually fairly nice, I can charge the buds up about 3-5 times before the case fully dies. Another con is the charging contacts. ANY grime on them and the buds will not charge, which when you're a mechanic, grime is the name of the game. Speaking of grime, another con is the way the ear wings are secured to the bud. As long as you're not a slob, the wings hold just fine, but if you get ANY oil on the silicone, they lose their holding strength and will slip around all the time, which leads to improper charging, loose fit, and needing to find new ear wings or using the smaller ones that the box provides for you.Overall all I do enjoy these buds and since starting to workout have bought another pair (which 3 weeks later got washed with the workout clothes - I really need to stop doing that). I'm up to a total of three pairs bought now and would say that as long as you're not putting them through hell as a mechanic or just a klutz, they'll serve you amazingly for a fairly affordable price.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2022",AFAXVD5LYR3DHQOWGWVRF7R2TJBA,True,14,Color: Midnight Black

R23CF22754SJZB,B09CGM1BWH,4.0 out of 5 stars Power throughout all frequencies,David C,4,"The fit was great. The tech support was awesome (as the apps always have trouble with my specific phone model) and the issue resolved within one day... yes one day. I was surprised by this myself. They are mid range price and are in that category for a reason. They are definitely at the top in that mid-range category, for me anyway. Let me explain. They produce very loud and mostly crisp music. I listen to all sorts of music but when Im in the gym I like em loud. I usually listen to Rap/ EDM and music that has alot of bass. Now the Linkbuds S I also got and even though the music is clearer and crisper it doesnt have the same umph. To compensate for the low bass you end up turning the gain up on the EQ and it further lowers the total loudness overall. So for me their is only a slight sacrifice of quality for a whole lot of extra quantity.The noise cancellation on these are mediocre at best. In the gym I can hear ALOT of whats going on around me and that was AFTER upgrading the stock silicone ear tips to comply premium sound dampening foam ones.So if your looking for loud and pretty darn clear youve found your earbuds probably. The microphone picks up alot of ambient noise as well and makes it difficult for the other person to hear you on a call which needs to be factored in. If your not using it for phone calls and/or in a noisy environment Id highly recommend these. I have to be honest though after trying the wf1000xm4's I cant go backwards. After hearing the best of all worlds unfortunately Im returning these and purchasing another pair on those. But if you cant afford that price range then these are a steal. Especially when comparing them to the Linkbuds S, for music anyway, at almost half of the price! Again if your purchasing these Soundcore earbuds to make calls and have background active noise cancellation then your making a mistake.","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2023",AG4S2SVU7QZKT77B4ET6L72LWRPQ,True,0,Color: Midnight Black

Contacted support thru app. Got a REPLACEMENT. Had doubts about right battery lasting less, seems fine enough tho.After the last update, got a last email for my doubt about the right bud replacement lasting a bit less (around half hour less), and seems normal given the right earbud is the ""Master unit"" that handles Bluetooth connection, which makes sense, specially since the replacement is a refurbished unit anyways.I'm hoping they last enough, I'm now using them daily for more than a week, and so far no issues.---- Update Dec. 2023:After revisiting them few more months later, I contacted support through app feedback. Support have been pretty attentive, even my long pauses between my replies.After some troubleshooting, they offered me a REPLACEMENT unit. Nice!So far a couple of days and the replacement have been working fine.Upping to 3/5 because of the kind support.Sadly, I'm afraid of the replacement failing in some way the following months as well, specially since I noticed the battery on the right replacement bud drains a bit faster than the left one.---- Original review:TL;DR:They were great. After 3.5 months, right one sounds muffled, even with little use, proper care, not getting wet. USELESS as stereo ""Hi-Fi"" now.>> Summary of issues noticed:- BAD Defect on balanced armature driver (I believe) on Right bud after 3.5 months.- Left one got charging/contact issues. Started after 1.5~2 months. Probably bad pogo pins. (cleaned with alcohol, got bit better but need to fiddle some times after placed)- Touch control is laggy, 1 sec delay, and quirky (sometimes easily triggered while grabbing buds from case, many times bad touch detection if not leaving proper time between followed touches).>> Good:- Multipoint makes easy to switch from phone and laptop.- Stable and LONG distance connection (much better than most of my Sony ones). They reconnect FAST on any issue.- Clear audio, enough customizations.----I really liked them and started using them more than my Sony dual driver ones in the period of 2 months; they sound clearer than the usual Sony earbuds.I have not yet used them a lot, I have maybe fully charged the case 4 times during this 3.5 months that I have been using them since receiving them, BUT....BUT then, the RIGHT one got partially Broken!The highs are now so low that it sounds MUFFLED!It's unbearable!

R1J846D84L4MK4,B09CGM1BWH,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty Happy Overall,Jimmy,4,"I received my headphones a couple of days ago and have only used them for maybe 4 - 5 hours so far. Here are my initial impressions.Pros:-Great battery life so far.-Microphone is amazing.-Audio is fantastic after personalizing it to suit my ears.-After customizing the earbuds and wingtips to my liking, it felt like I would get ear fatigue after extended use. Seems like this isn't an issue for me which I am happy about.-Can connect to 2 Bluetooth enabled devices at a time. You can't listen to the devices at the same time, but it'll swap back and forth automatically when it detects audio being played.Cons:-It has 3 modes: Stereo, Mono, and Call. You cannot adjust the controls for Call mode. You are able to use touch controls to answer, decline, or hang up the call, but this means you can't adjust the volume or swap between ANC and transparency mode (You can still do this manually, just not with touch controls).-Would it kill them to add a mute gesture?-The case is very bulky compared to my previous ones. They look nice, but don't expect them to be comfortable in tight pockets.-Minor gripe, but not the easiest to remove headphones from the charging case.-Must download app to use noise cancellation. I'm not sure why this isn't an option by default.-ANC seems mediocre. It does soften the sound of your surroundings, but don't expect it to be deadly quiet or anything. I've never owned any headphones with ANC before, so take this with a grain of salt.Neutral:-Can edit controls and change EQ by downloading their app. I personally don't like downloading excess apps onto my phone. Can probably just uninstall it after customizing it to your tastes, but it also comes with firmware updates which is probably a good thing.-Wireless charging makes a clicking noise. I was concerned at first since my phone doesn't do this, but a quick search online shows this is normal, and I don't need to worry about any explosions.Update: After using the headphones for about a week, I have a couple new observations.First, when LDAC is turned on, there are times when the audio momentarily spasms/glitches out. This happens maybe around once every 20 - 30 minutes or so. It does say in the app that enabling LDAC may make you occasionally experience connection instability, but I imagine most buyers wouldn't know this until after they already made the purchase. Note multipoint and LDAC can not be activated at the same time either.Second, there is some latency between the headphones and the device it is connected to. This is normal, but I thought I'd mention it anyway. YouTube seems to do a good job detecting and accounting for this, but if you play games or watch videos on a different streaming platform, you'll notice a delay between actions on the screen and the audio coming out of your headphones.","Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2023",AENHFF2TPU2XLEXSITGEB5RLJEVQ,True,5,Color: Midnight Black
R1K5P32H5FA9E4,B09CGM1BWH,5.0 out of 5 stars Old Man Hates Earbuds Falls in Love With These Gems,sjf,5,"First, let's get the battery out of the way. I've only had these a week, and my internal jury is still out on battery life. I not unhappy, yet, but I could be.Next, you should know that I am an Anker fan. And the reason will become evident in a moment.I need to be able to connect to two devices at once. I have tried several others, including ones made by Jabra, Plantronics, etc. And I have a very difficult time with earbuds. So, I also need flexibility when it comes to fit. Oh, and I can't stand things in my ears to begin with.FitThe Liberty 3 Pro's do not feel like they are in my ears and I can wear them for hours without having to adjust them. Read that again. There's no hyperbole in that statement. Seriously, hours on Zoom and the phone without having to even tweak the fit.Even the way you put them in your ears in unique in all the others I've ever tried. You don't push them in at all, you place against your ear and lightly twist backwards. And they seat perfectly. (You can test your for in the app.)There may be others out there that fit like this, but I haven't found one.SoundThe Soundcore app is as good as you will find. The obligatory fit test, sounds profiles, you know, standard stuff. But, here again, Anker goes above and beyond.The HearID sound test is amazing. I use the word amazing because it has solved a problem that I've had for years, my hearing is really bad and I am forever tweaking my equalizer settings to try to get what I know I should be hearing. Well, let me tell you something. I hear every note. I have compared the settings Soundcore created for me against all of the professional profiles included with the app, and it isn't even close. Anker dusts them. Again, there may be others out there, but I haven't found one.Customizable buttonsAnker sets thre default for tapping once to do nothing. You can change this, of course, but why would you? The mere act of scratching an itch can set it off, and in others out usually does. But not here. Customize these buttons to your heart's content.DesignHere is the crux of it all. Design. I must have found Anker by accident at some point, not paying to much attention, but it wasn't long untili realized that, when it came to products they make, the ones with which I was consistently impressed were made by Anker.And I mean impressed. In every case, batteries, chargers, webcams (singularly, the best I've ever used), power strips - you name it, these designers are something else. Instead of thinking, ""Why the heck did they design this to..."" you will be thinking, ""Holy ergonomics, Batman, they get it.""I am rarely loyal to a brand for much reason at all. Think Starbucks; I can't stand Dunkin'coffee. But Anker? I will go to them first everytime because they design really, really well. The device, the app, the whole package. Now you know why I'm a fan.","Reviewed in the United States September 17, 2022",AEEW4UK57KXDCGKZCE3VDU67S5YA,True,18,

Also didn't have issue with battery life that is when they actually charged. Comfortable to wear but not too secure while jogging and they will often fall out when leaning forward.The most annoying was the case. It is slim but just didn't work well. The buds will stay connected when in the case if you do not close the case. As if you are somehow listening to them while they are in the case. Also while it has magnets to make sure that the buds are secure in the case and in proper position for charging, I would often find that they weren't charging. A small light under the bud is supposed to signify that they are charging but that wasn't always the case and plenty of times returned to a dead bud.Obviously you get what you pay for but disappointing from the Anker name.","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2024",AGDOZRNB7VBWQJ6UY5243S3TWUMA,True,0,Color: Midnight Black

R31C7GJRALP67V,B09CGM1BWH,5.0 out of 5 stars Many QOL Improvements Over Bose QuietComfort II,Sealands,5,"I use the earbuds for: Gym, Airplane travel, and Concentration.What made me purchased Anker Liberty 3: This could be a design flaw of the Bose earbuds. After two years of usage. I could no longer charge the earbuds with the black rubber rings on it. I would need to remove it each time I need to charge or turn it off. If left on, the earbuds does not make contact with the charging case causing it not to charge and remain turned on until battery runs out. I started noticing after my earbuds were not charged over several hours or overnight.Features: 5/5 The Anker have many features over the Bose. One of my most important feature for me is the ability to turn off touch sensitivity on the earbuds. When I'm running or doing other activities I tend to adjust the earbuds for comfort. With the Bose app I am not able to turn this off and more than often when I touch the earbuds. It either pauses or goes into another mode. Super annoying. If you prefer to keep the touch feature Anker does offer several options for convenient such as taps to change options. For me, I'm going to keep it off and adjust on my phone/computer/tablet.Sound: Treble 5/5 - Mid 4/5 - Bass 5/5 - Surround 5/5. The stereo surround sound gives a sense there's many speakers and placed far apart. Also, the app allows for easy custom equalizer adjustments. I find the Anker highs are clear, bass strong punch but not muffled when compared to Bose.Noise Cancellation: 4/5. The Bose earbuds does block ambient noises better but will cost more and with less quality of life features as I have described above.Value: 5/5. For the price $90 the Anker is a bargain.Conclusion: Now that I finally decided to go with another brand other than Bose or Sony. I'm happy with my purchase. I save money and honestly think the Anker is better than the Bose. I will be buying another Anker for my family member.","Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2024",AET36HXKFCBLOZDTQYGWFZFKZ5AQ,True,6,Color: Midnight Black
R2MZIAMTVG8O7M,B09CGM1BWH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good enough for the price, if you can get it on sale",Junvic Valdez,4,"I am impressed of the performance of these wireless buds for this price range. I mainly wanted to try it out of curiosity, using it for listening to music on my phone. While it doesn't exceed my overall expectations, I am fairly satisfied.Getting started with the Soundcore Liberty Pro 3 is straightforward. Just take the buds out of the packaging, install your preferred eartip and ear wing (?) sizes, pair the wireless buds with your device, and you're good to go.For first time use I recommend downloading the companion Soundcore app on your smartphone. You'll be able to get the most out of these buds if you customize them via the app. Lots of things can be changed such as the connection quality (they support LDAC for best music quality), noise cancelling (which can be tailor fit to your ears using the HearID system), and the sound signature (also can be tailor fit using HearID). You can also customize gestures for various functionalities for easy access. In my opinion the app is one of the best value-adds for this product. My only complaint is one time it wiped my customizations for the Liberty Pro 3, but so far has only happened once.Sound quality is so-so, nothing to write home about, but not terribly disappointing either. In my opinion these buds shine in the vocal department (seems they were designed for calls?). I enjoyed female vocals in particular with these buds. For me the vocal presence is just right - not too elevated, but still discernible from the rest of the songs. Bass is present, but seems to sound artificially elevated and bloated at times, most notable in electronic music tracks that are bass-heavy. Treble can get a bit sibilant and you'll notice this with cymbals and strings. For this price range I can't complain, but admittedly there are better options sound quality wise. I recommend fine-tuning the EQ using the Soundcore app, especially to tame the trebles, and to make the bass sound more natural.Active noise cancellation is surprisingly good, especially if you use the app to calibrate the ANC to your ears. With a good seal on the buds I could hear minimal noise while commuting. The transparency mode lets you hear people talking to you for example and is quite convenient in certain cases.I don't have any complaints with the battery life. I've been using these more or less every weekend for the past month and I haven't needed to charge the case yet. Every time I take them out of the case they're always fully charged with minimal battery drain on the case itself.Are the Soundcore Liberty 3 Pros a good buy? I'd say wait for a price drop and these can be great value for the money. At a $110 asking price, I'd consider other options before buying these.","Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2023",AEEJXEKPZD4D6HV634O3NTYKNURA,True,5,Color: Midnight Black
R2IWM0AREN9PBP,B09CGM1BWH,"3.0 out of 5 stars Mixed feelings, I somewhat recommend",B Jenks,3,"I've had these earbuds for five or six months and there have been a few ups and downs. Overall, these are good. The sound quality if phenomenal and hard to beat. Not just for the price, but period. I'm currently testing out some more expensive earbuds, the Beats Fit Pro, and those sound great but the Liberty 3 Pros are clearly better. As is typical with Anker/Soundcore, you get a lot of bang for your buck. The sound settings and HearID functions are great. A physical button is a bit easier to use, but these touch controls work fairly well. You get ANC and Transparency. I don't really use ANC, but I use transparency/ambient mode a lot. It works, but is definitely not best in class. I can hear folks around me, but there have been times when I still feel compelled to take the earbuds out to still hear someone. For comparison, the Beats Fit Pros make me forget they're there and I have yet to feel the need to take them out to hear clearly when in transparency mode. You also get LDAC and multi-point pairing. LDAC to me doesn't make much of a difference and the multi-point pairing is really cool and convenient at times, but I wouldn't be bothered if it wasn't a feature.So you get all of these great things for much cheaper than the competitors, what the problem? If it sounds to good to be true, it likely is. There are some concessions to be made in order to deliver all that with immense cost savings. The biggest way that shows up for me is that the connectivity is a bit janky. The audio often drops out at times, especially if I'm out and about. Soundcore will say that's because you're using LDAC mode which messes up connectivity in order to deliver the higher quality audio. However, I don't use LDAC mode and still have these issues and have seen other people with the same complaint. Also, the earbuds don't always connect properly when taking them out of the case. Sometimes one bud won't connect and I have to put them back in the case and pull them back out. Furthermore, when putting the buds in the case to charge/turn them off, it does not always work. This mostly seems to be an issue with the right bud. I will set it in the case and the magnets snap in, but for some reason it does not register that the bud is there, which leaves it on/connected. For a while I did not realize this was happening so I would have times where I would miss texts/calls because my phone wouldn't ring out loud because it's still connected to the earbud. Also, depending on the length between usage, I would go to put the buds in for a workout or something and they battery would be completely drained. Now that I'm aware of this issue, I pay closer attention to this and at least half of the time I have to fiddle with the earbud until it registers that it's in the case. Also, I've gone back and forth a bit with Soundcore on these issues and I'm on my 3rd pair and the problems still persist. So I know it's not a situation where I received a defective pair.Overall, the price, audio quality and features makes me want to highly recommend these buds. However, the connectivity issues makes it hard for me to do it. If you think you're fine with the connectivity issues, then by all means, check them out. I've mostly been able to make due with the jank because I love the audio quality so much, but it can get pretty annoying. I've had much cheaper earbuds that don't have those issues. They're also quite bulky in my opinion, so that's another thing. Maybe if they drop LDAC and multi-point to make room in the budget for a more stable connection and smaller build quality, I would find these near perfect.","Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2022",AH4RRIOHNQAMOZFOIXGFVI5CQ7JA,True,1,

R1J1Z7YHKIAL33,B09CGM1BWH,4.0 out of 5 stars Great buds,B Halt,4,"So let me first start by saying, I bought these during Prime day. A few days beforehand I had bought the sound core sports X10 buds. Now those are really good buds in their own right. But I return them to Amazon to get these. Since I bought the X 10 sport for pretty much the same price that these Liberty 3 Pros were on sale for during Prime. This is my second pair of Liberty Pros. I had the Liberty 2 Pros a couple years back they were great buds but like the Liberty tattoos, the Liberty threes, don't completely fit my ears properly. I use these for the gym and when I sweat a lot the ear tips and wings end up sliding somewhat in my ears. But having said that that's my only complaint about these buds. For the price they cannot be beat at all. I would even dare to say they are better than the Sony xm4 earbuds. And I say that because due to the update that Sony had come a lot of the right earbuds are not holding charges longer than 10 minutes. And for the price they charge for them, you might as well just get these and save some money and buy something else. Especially since the sound quality of these buds match the Sony's. I would even say these match and maybe in some ways surpass the Sennheiser momentum threes. They have great of sound quality. They're not as good as Sony or Bose in the noise canceling but they rival the Sennheiser momentums in noise canceling. These are in my rotation to use for everyday listening or the gym. And I only have them behind the Technica A60 and Sony Link buds. As in my opinion the a60s have better sound but maybe not as loud as the Liberty threes and the Sony links noise canceling is better. As long as Soundcore continues to honor their warranties and give good customer service. I will always recommend these. I would just to Soundcore, to work on those wing tips and ear tips for the buds. Some of us like to use them for the gym and sweat a lot. aAnd the material they use for them, doesn't lend itself to stay in the ears snuggly.

The packaging is by far the best the I have seen with any earbuds and comes with four different sizes of ear pillows to assure that you have the proper fit. The charging case is very unique as the cover slides up so it is difficult for the cover to pop open when accidentally dropped causing the ear buds to come out and scatter on the floor. The sound is excellent and has strong bass, crisp treble and is clear. The ANC could be better but it is still effective. The most disappointing part for me is the app that you can download.

R1A2BUFFPHWPUM,B09CGM1BWH,"2.0 out of 5 stars They'd be decent buds, if only they'd charge properly",Clara C,2,"The review from godzilla (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KD7YWRN88JGB) covered most of the issues with this product.Audio quality is crap, but I'll grant that I'm a bit picky. Still, there's cheaper or similarly-priced buds that sound better.For ANC: I often turn it off in the presence of higher-pitched speech, as the passive NC is usually good enough. ANC drains the battery aggressively, too, so I avoid using it if I can help it. About what i'd expect from buds this size, not too different from any other product in this category, so I don't blame the product as much as knowing that ANC itself has its limits as to what types of sounds can be blocked out. It works best for constant droning sounds, like the sounds of a fan or something, and for that purpose it works quite well.The shape is really comfortable for my ears, and they do provide a proper seal. Does make cleaning harder as wax can get in crevices, but I can live with that as the price for strong passive NC.The ""multi device"" support is awful, it only supports two devices, and is chronically incapable of knowing which device is actually playing audio. Jabra and Plantronics headsets seem to do a lot better job at this. Basically, you'll be pulling out the app, a lot, and disconnecting it from whatever other device happened to be in the area, just to play audio from your phone.Sometimes there are also issues connecting to a saved device, which I usually resolve by sticking the buds in the case and flicking it open and closed a few times.But by far, the biggest issues I ran into were around charging.You have no way to tell if the buds are charging without opening the case and looking at the lights underneath the buds. Unfortunately, opening the case is also how you connect the buds to devices, which means that simply trying to check if it's charging will often connect the buds to some device, using power. Closing the case with the buds inside *should* disconnect the buds, but this is not reliable, so sometimes you come back to a completely drained pair of buds despite leaving in the case for a while.I've also had to keep the buds on a completely flat surface to ensure the pins keep in contact - else, you guessed it, I'd come back to drained buds. This kills the portability aspect, if you want to put the case in your bag or something, naturally it wouldn't stay flat.The case itself is also terribly designed - the outside has 3 LEDs, indicating battery level. But I've frequently had situations where it'll show 3 LEDs filled before I put the buds in, and I come back to the buds at 10% battery and the case shows 1 LED filled. So basically, the ""charging"" case doesn't even charge the buds properly, and the only way to guarantee the buds are charged is by plugging the case itself into a wall charger.... wonder what genius came up with that. This also kills portability.I've since resorted to overcharging the case, and even with that, the case will only charge the buds for about 1.5 to 2 full charges. As the buds don't even last a full working day (maybe 6 hours at best with ANC off), that really gets annoying over time...Anyway, if you can snag these on sale, might be worth it, but retail price is certainly not.","Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2024",AEBS65CPJCAM6DQGWXM2NSVCDRGQ,True,2,
R1N6HMK48XEZUB,B09CGM1BWH,5.0 out of 5 stars Never Heard Music this Way,PikeG2,5,"First and foremost, I am coming from the LG wrap around neck bands, for which I have had a hard time wanting to transition to the 'truly wireless' earbuds. This is because I enjoy being able to take the earbud out of my ear and then just dropping it on my chest. I've been a Paramedic for many years now and the convenience of the wrap around neck bands has served me well in this aspect, of just pulling the earbud out and go... Until now! Holy WOW. I have truly never experienced music this way before. I was rocking my kid to sleep last night and I used the ANC with good music and I couldn't believe the amount of detail in the music that I have never heard before. In particular, in one of the songs there was a Lyricist that went from the left ear to the right ear but was only in the background and I have never had the pleasure of hearing this before. It blew my mind, I've heard this song thousands of times (Bone Thugs-N-Harmony The Crossroads). It was like you could actually individualize, or individually identify all the parts of the music that are going on because it was so clear. Now, I researched all the different major players in this game. I looked at the Sony, Soundcore, Bose, Technics, etc... I watched all the reviews online, mainly Flossy, of course! (He really does give a ""real review"") and ultimately I decided on these. I could not be more happy with my choice. I don't have a lot of other examples to go on, given that I haven't had a pair of truly wireless earbuds before. But I think this was a great purchase. There are, with that said, two complaints that I do have on this product. The first being the battery life on the earbuds themselves are not the greatest in terms of the time you have to listen to music until you have to put them in the case again. But I believe soundcore is pretty honest about the timing of the battery for the earbuds. The second thing is that I really really wish there was a way to turn up the transparency mode. Transparency mode sounds great but it is not loud enough. Once you turn your music up past 20% you can no longer hear anything around you. Possibly even as much as 15%. But if you're just listening to a podcast at a low volume transparency mode works well. I hope they come out with a firmware update giving the ability to turn transparency mode up. This is a long review so I'll end on a positive note. The HearID, in which it gives you a hearing test and adjusts your EQ accordingly, I believe really makes a big difference in the way it sounds specifically for me. You can test this by going into the app and changing the EQ settings manually. Anyway, I couldn't say enough good things about these earbuds right now. Wish I had the white pair for my wife, since now she wants mine. If I have any issues I will most definitely update this review.

R30KACQ9WXUN68,B09CGM1BWH,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Sound and Clarity!!!,Noel,5,"I didn’t expect much from these. However, I am very well aware Anker has amazing and excellent customer service . That alone gave me the confidence to invest in an Anker product and try these. For starters I was impressed immediately with the Liberty Pros 3, but I still took it a step further and bought the Bose Quiet Comfort II and the Beats Studio Buds for comparison.The Bose were more comfortable for my ears but for the price range Soundcore sounded pretty damn good and with a swap of memory foam tips it was a comfy fit. I’d said they give the Bose a run for the money. Highs and lows are well balanced. For what Bose costs I’m disappointed. The Liberty Pros felt and looked well designed, more metal incorporated into the design, which gave it not only a good look but made it structurally sound. The wireless charging gave these another bonus point (Bose lacked this). Now as for the app - WOW!! For someone like me who has some mild to moderate hearing loss in my left ear and can’t hear certain frequencies I appreciate what they did.You can use the hearing test (Hearing ID) - to customize the sound. The test is almost like the one I had at the doctors where they put me in a sound proof room with headphones and when I heard faint beeps I’d press a remote. On the app you tap the screen. Ultimately you get a custom chart and you can see which frequencies your ear detects. Then you can STILL go in and adjust the frequencies manually to fine tune them. This in turn allows the buds to produce a maximum tailored sound JUST FOR YOU! Can’t say Bose had anything close to this. In fact Bose didn’t even have equalizer options nowhere near like the Liberty Pro app.Moving to the Beats. I can say the case is MUCH bigger not even as nice as Liberty’s soft suede like feel. Not to mention the Liberty’s internal case lights up - very nice touch! Especially if you’re on a plane or in the dark. As for sound, the Beats are nice and sounded good, but the highs don’t reach close to the Liberty. I also tend to accidentally touch the sides of the Beats and it changes songs on me because the external buttons click to the touch. The Liberty Pro 3 lets you program the taps to your own choosing. The ANC and Transparent mode may not be like the Beats since they have Apple’s seamless connection but even then they’re only about 2 clicks difference and not a deal breaker.Ultimately, they are well worth it. The endless options will guarantee you will have an immersive experience. No regrets here.","Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2023",AEPY2HQQIKFA7RCYTTCJJ55JO66A,True,3,Color: Midnight Black
RPJS4D48ZPF30,B09CGM1BWH,3.0 out of 5 stars Major issues with functionality steal any listening pleasure they offer,*londyjamel*,3,"Tl;dr: These are the single most frustrating and disappointing pair of earbuds I have ever had the displeasure of using. They're fiddly to fit and insert. Their performance is inconsistent. The sensitivity to touch, issues with charging in the case, unwanted connectivity, and general gremlins with using them has really destroyed any enthusiasm I had when I first bought them.Let's start with the minor quibbles, shall we? Typically, I'm a more options kinda person. While I appreciate the many options for fit, I found all of the various combos of ear tips and wings to be a bit much when first approaching the buds and establishing what fit and seal should be without actually knowing what they should sound like. I've had them fall out gradually slip from my ears while on my walks.Major complaints:1. Sensitivity. The earbuds are much too sensitive to touch. While inserting or adjusting them, these touches constantly affect the operation of the bud(s): pausing, changing volume, skipping through audiobook chapters. Once they come out of the case they're connecting. And ready to party.2. Charging in the case. I can have charged the case overnight, but when I go to insert them, one will have a very low charge or will be completely dead. The case will show fully charged. So how?3. Functionality of the case and connectivity. Okay, here we go. When closed, the case should be charging the buds. When the lid is closed, nothing should be connected to ANYTHING. Closing the case should disconnect any devices, right? But no. I'll have music playing from some mysterious source: not my phone, not my watch, not my iPad... Yes, my iPad that I almost never ever use with the earbuds. It's like once you disconnect from one device, it just cycles through to the next device. This may also contribute to the low battery issue because one earbud is discharged and has been defiantly transmitting.I've examined the contact points in the case and made sure that the lights are on for each bud and close the case and they'll STILL answer my phone or disconnect my call when I close the case to switch to another option for handling the call.I've really wanted these to work, but they just don't. I let the return window close believing that it was user error, but so many reviews and Reddit posts mention the same troubles that I have. The ANC is pretty good, when I'm out walking, I have some level of transparency on.These should be amazing earbuds with seamless wireless listening, a great case for charging and using the buds independently of the other, and a great seal for excellent listening. They aren't. Notice I haven't talked about listening? That's because all the other frustrations don't let me enjoy or even experience the exquisite sound that there are supposed to have.","Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2023",AHSG33ERDJRN2FUIIQ7YT3BG2X7Q,True,4,Color: Midnight Black

To be fair, I haven't timed them, but it seems like I can get half a day at best.I would recommend these for low usage or short term usage. So if you're hitting the gym or mowing the lawn, these would be good for the price and value. I would not recommend these for an office setting if you are in online meetings regularly.","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2024",AEJJWYMPV5RPD2DFPH5R4GTZK2QA,True,0,Color: Midnight Black

R1DX7GEMWM7R6Y,B09CGM1BWH,4.0 out of 5 stars Not Impressed...AT ALL (UPDATE: Semi Impressed but still not the best. ),Reservoir Dogg,4,"Soundcore support was responsive to my inquiry. This is what I feel now, after a few months of stringent use.I use these buds for work and traveling. I use one bud at a time at work to take IT support calls. The biggest issue is they run out of battery power before my shift is done. Charging them is ""weird"" I'll charge the case in the evening and expect to have close to 100% at least in the AM. This is rarely the case, this is when using several different charging sources like the same sung note 10 charger, Fold 3 charger or the apple ipad 12.9 charger . The bud 2s seem to be more reliable as far as charging is concerned.Another concern I have it most of the time there is no seamless handshake from one device to the other. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Jabra's line of buds handles this aspect much better as you could simultaneously listen to both devices if you wanted to while the Soundcore, it can only use one device at a time though two can be connected.Sound quality is very good and slightly better than the Liberty 2.Fitment is interesting. The issue is that if you don't have the rubber pieces on properly, not only will it not work well but it may affect charging. I thought this was the issue but I went as far as removing these ears and still have charging issues.END OF UPDATEI bought these on pure hype and the mention these could be connected to more than one device. I have the Liberty 2 buds and they can only connect to one device when I could 4 device options. Well, it hasn't even been 2 months and the left bud died. Prior to this issue, the buds did perform ""adequate"". Sound was maybe slightly more detailed than the Liberty 2 buds. The adjustable wing feature, I'm not sure about. They seem to trap more heat in my ears which in 105 degree weather is not comfortable. Noise cancellation was...""Adequate"". I flew on planes and it's better than no cancellation at all but that's about it. Maybe I just got a bad pair? I heard raving review online but may it was all just hype. I guess I'll use my liberty 2 buds for now until this gets resolve. That's if it gets resolved.","Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2022",AH2GSP7SCXRO2J2Z45BOOURTQXWA,True,2,Color: Midnight Black

Baby blue.",EZ PC Tech,3,"UPDATE: Loses connectionIn addition to everything below, this is the second pair of Soundcore buds (the first one is P3) that can't connect to any device even after they were paired before and worked just fine.They just can't be seen by phone/app until you put them in the case for a second or two and remove them again.It's terrible because I grabbed them in a hurry and went to the gym just to find out that they couldn't connect, so I spent 2 hours in the gym without music.Pros and cons (2023)Pros:1. The earbuds have a nice scope of delivery.2. The sound quality is great and on par with the latest Air Pods (2023).3. The earbuds are comfortable to wear.4. HearID helps to adjust the EQ, which is a huge plus.5. The price is totally worth it at $80.Cons:1. Color... I wanted grey or white earbuds, that's why I bought Fog Grey which looks whitish in the pictures. What I received was more like baby blue. I mean, they are not just don't look like in the pictures, but they are not grey at all. Not even remotely (see picture).2. Noise cancelation is not great. I used HearID and tried multiple ear tips but it was still pretty mediocre. Not a problem for me, since I don't care much about it, but if this is the reason why you buy them - it might not work for you well.3. Battery doesn't show the percentage in the app (just a battery icon with bars), so you have no idea how much exactly charge you have.4. Sometimes it is not possible to switch between noise-canceling options during a call via messenger applications, although it is possible through the app. Additionally, each time the earbuds are disconnected, noise canceling automatically goes into ""normal"" mode instead of the one that you chose.All in all, yes, they are a great value (if they are on sale for $80), but there are some issues that are fixable (if the manufacturer will want to), and I'd totally love them if they'd be as they are on the picture, but they literally have color that I don't like most.I'd probably buy the white one instead of what they call grey (which is clearly blue), but they are more expensive, so they no longer have that great value.I spoke with Soundcore CS to ask why the grey is blue, and they offered to buy another color and they'll match the price (15% discount) but I must do it through their website, while I prefer Amazon.","Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2023",AFF33XCFDK4KGMYUPISF2LDS5ODA,True,4,

RFYMZ805HVGBN,B09CGM1BWH,"3.0 out of 5 stars Overall good, but some minor disappointments",Simon Yung,3,"I'm a big fan of Soundcore's products. I think they bring extremely high value to the table in the headphone category. So, i really do want them to succeed.I've had the Liberty 2 Pros since they launched and have thoroughly enjoyed using them. They were comfortable, sounded great (really great!) and the app allowed for customization I never had with all my previous headphones.The L3P are really good. But there are definitely some good things about the L2P that didn't carry over, in my opinion. Here's my review after a few weeks of use (11/2/21).Feature Set:I think this is where these buds are quite outstanding.1. Multi-point connection2. fully customizable touch controls (singe, double, triple, long touch)3. ANC/Transparency (more on this below)4. Updated codecs (honestly, i don't care about this much, but it's nice that this is being updated)Fit (subjective):I thought the L2P fit better in my ears. Like, almost to the degree that they feel custom-molded. The LP3 are comfortable, but I did experience some fatigue after wearing it for about an hour. I think it can get used to it and eventually it won't bother me anymore. I know this is gonna be different for everyone, but that's my take.Sound (also subjective):I think they sound great. The sound signature is a little different, but with the app, I was able to customize it to the way I like to hear my music. One disappointment, however, is that these are noticeably lower output than the L2P. That's something I miss about the L2P.ANC: works well enough. Could be better, but generally satisfied. I always thought the seal was sufficient for me.Transparency: could use some work. It ""works"" but doesn't sound as natural as the Airpods Pro (my reference point for this feature - which I understand is a relatively high bar). Perhaps a firmware update can address this.Case:Man, this slippery matte finish really sucks! If i've just washed my hands, and they've a little damp, it's not a problem. but when my hands are just dry, i cannot handle these as confidently as the old ones. Maybe this is something I'll get used to eventually, but it really seems like a cut corner with the finish on the case.Overall design:It's fine. I like it. not a huge fan of the big glossy look on the main touch surface of it, but *shrug* But everything on the backside of it looks very thoughtfully designed and ""premium.""Miscellaneous - Problem with app:I've been having to deal with this since i received the L3P, but I don't think it's the fault of the L3P. But ever since i paired the L3P with my phone, the custom EQ profiles in the app have been behaving very strangely.1. Every time disconnect the L3P and put them into the case and then reconnect them, a new Custom EQ will have been created. And i'm always having to manually delete this. This bug has also spread to the L2P device profile, causing the same exact issue.2. While using the L3P, I can toggle between every ""Sound Effect"" (HearID, 3D Surround, Default, Custom EQ) and the EQ profile for each selection will change EXCEPT for the Custom EQ. In order to activate the Custom EQ, i'll have to go into the wave form and tap on any of the sliders. It's annoying. Customer service has been somewhat responsive, but so far its been a series of email replies, which take at least 24 hours each...and it's just taking so long to get this matter resolved.","Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2021",AEIDJXLNGOZKJBZOEW3YNI3OUZSA,True,3,Color: Midnight Black
R3H547M9MSI3KS,B09CGM1BWH,5.0 out of 5 stars Update: I like em a lot,NOFATCHICK1,5,"I've had the Sound Core liberty 2 Pro for over a year they have been my favorite pair, so I was excited when Anker release the L3P. I'll keep this quick and simple the ANC is pretty weak, they offer less buds than the older Liberty 2 pro so it's harder to get a good fit, the older Liberty 2 pro are louder, the touch controls are very finicky and doesn't register my input a lot of times. The liberty 3 Pro are brighter and even sound sibilant/piercing at times, and the vocals as a whole sound ""thin""you can adjust in the app but it doesn't completely fix it. If you have the 1st generation Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro I would not recommend upgrading, some songs on the older L2P sound a lot better.Update: Anker offered to send me a free pair back in order to give them another chance, with that said I'm not sure if the ankers got an update, but I felt that they responded much better to EQ this time around. After 40 hours of using the earbuds I can say I really like them, but they by no means are perfect. Sound out the box is not very good, I had to lower the bass, and the treble (which is very sharp out the box) and increase the mids a bit. I don't personally like Hear ID, I feel like it just boosted the treble even further to sound harsher. The soundstage on the earphones are outstanding, as well and the bass, very deep and tight fast bass. The earphones are an absolute joy to listen with Hip hop and Rap music. I feel that the earbuds do a much better job with male vocals and bass heavy songs, on some female tracks with higher frequencies it can struggle a bit and sound harsh. But for Hip hop, Edm, bass heavy tracks they are my favorite earbuds to listen to. I love these for the gym as they are very comfortable, stay in my ears, and are great for workout songs. The ANC is not very strong, my Edifier neobuds pro as comparison have a much more effective ANC and those cost less. Also the transparency mode on the edifier are more effective and natural sounding as well, but the ankers still do a good job and I like that when using transparency mode on the ankers and I like that when a loud sound in the environment occurs (Like a truck or bathroom dryer) it will turn on the ANC, so the loud sound doesn't hurt your ears and then turn transparency back on. The earbuds have a very good app, I like the lights on the case so you know the battery, I like the lights inside the case, just makes it feel more premium. The case is a little slippery, but that's really nit picking. With that said I really like the earbuds after using them the past few weeks. The edifier Neo buds pro are my one of my favorite current earbuds, and lately I have been grabbing the ankers over them, that's how much I like them. On top of that Anker has outstanding customer service. These definitely deserve a try.","Reviewed in the United States October 11, 2021",AFETWHI4GVLRCXBCT3QNZWKU4CBA,True,198,
RGOVNWS2GNXCW,B09CGM1BWH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Awesome ear buds, but poor fitting options",E. M. Zobrist,4,"I have used these for over 6 months now. They are top quality audio devices comparable with ones that are double (or even triple) their price. The Soundcore app is good, it allows you to adjust the equalizer and noise cancelling setting from your phone. I like that when you remove one from your ear, it automatically pauses any audio, so you can understand whomever is talking to you. You don't have to pause or miss anything. The case charges wirelessly, as well as having a USB-C port. It does seem that wireless charging takes a while, but probably due to the small charging coil.I had an old set of Life A1 and loved them, so when I upgraded I wanted something similar. The only problem I have, and I deducted 1 star, is the adjustable fit ""bands"" are really flimsy. You can replace them with 4 sizes, but they are not strong enough to stay in my ear. Also, they detach from the base easily, so every time I take them out, the band comes off. This did not happen at first, so I can only assume the plastic has worn out over the last 6 months.","Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2023",AGC6SF4WN3ZJLA7JH5Y2ENHFPZKQ,True,2,Color: Midnight Black
R3FRJB27U5F6M8,B09CGM1BWH,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great features, good sound,really good all-round",sunjoy,4,"Evaluating vs Sony XM4 buds: these k(Liberty 3) are more comfortable in my ears, stay put much better (they have wingtips), and important for wireless, they have great customizable controls. Sony falls far short in the controls and you are forced to choose 2 or of 3 functions (volume, play/pause/skip, or transparency/ANC). Usually with my phone in a pocket, bag or the next room, I want all three of these functions at ones. Liberty 3 and Samsung earbuds allow this. Sony does not.Sound is quite good on the Liberty 3 for casual listening (ie at work, or while doing an activity). For pure listening I prefer the Sony, but tbh both models are good. Liberty has a bit more of a synthetic sound, Sony more like wood. Liberty 3 is honestly more easy for listening to music just for fun in the the background (or jogging). Sony seems to give me more detail and enjoyment when I sit down and listen for nuances and details. So Liberty for ""fun"" and ""casual"", Sony for deep enjoyment.ANC is way better in the Sony. In trains and buses the Sony ANC sucks away a lot of background soundw while with the liberty 3 I hear so much background that sometimes I'm not sure if ANC is on or off. (It does help quiet things, but not to the extent of Sony). Sony uses foam tips which give good passive noise isolation, so maybe Liberty 3 would be better with foam tips.Form: both brands are good, I find the liberty case is flatter, and fits into pockets better, but Sony's fit into pockets just fine.Ultimately I am going to return the Sonys because although I like their sound better, they move around in my ear (not falling out, but getting loose), which makes the proximity sensor trip, and then the buds pause of turn off. This happens even while seated on Zoom calls, which makes them unusable for giving presentations.TLDR: the liberty is a good earphone to have around town, while jogging, at work. Sony has better ANC but falls short because of the limited controls. For listening at Home the Sonys seem a bit better, but then I might as well break out wired high quality headphones if I want that experience anyway.","Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2022",AFETPKJP6PYYGKTEYOSKQI4X3F2A,True,4,

I purchased these during Amazon’s prime discount window for a great price and I’m happy with them! At full price, I may have returned them. I am not an audiophile - I just like good sound quality when I listen to music to concentrate or to get in a groove, which these do. I also like a good seal to block out airplane-people noise, which these are not doing for me. See below.Pro’s:- Good sound quality after using the Soundcore app to go through the Hear ID test. Turns out I can’t really hear midrange well at all and using the Hear ID sound made a world of difference in sound quality for me.- Small compact size though these will never be in my pockets because #laundry.- Great battery life!- Touch controls are easy and convenient once you get to know them or customize them through the app.Not-So-Pro’s but not con’s:- In spite of the many ear tip and wing combinations, I can’t find a combo that provides a nice seal. So the ANC doesn’t do much for me though it’s noticeable. I still get a ton of sound leakage. I may try some flange tips which I prefer for blocking if I can find some that fit in the case.- The Transparent mode is weird. To me, it feels like it *enhances* outside sound. I won’t be using it. Maybe if I can get to a good seal, it’ll be more useful.- While the Hear ID is neat and was useful, I’m not sure why I needed them. I have an old pair of Shure SE425’s that sound amazing, hearing damage and all, and they didn’t need an app to do that.- The earbuds themselves are pretty big. I don’t think people with small ears will find these to be a good fit.I haven’t tried it for voice calls yet though that’s not my primary purpose for these. I haven’t tried running with these to see if they stay in. They don’t fit great, so I don’t expect they’ll stay in for me.

There are however other issues.The earbuds have a difficult time connecting properly to the charging/holding pod. I would have to keep reseating it to get it start charging the earbud. There have been a few occasions where I did not realize that it was not properly attached, so despite wearing only one earbud it was playing music on both buds depleting both batteries.The default setting whenever you put on the earbuds is transparency. Which I do not understand, so when every I put it on suddenly I just get amplified outside noise. I then have to quickly switch it to a different setting. At least the touch sensor to change settings (one tap, two taps, and hold) is decent and customizable. I have attempted several times in the app to set my default as normal, however it is always overridden.They provide several different size of rubber gaskets to hold the earbud properly in your ear, however they do not stay on the earbud properly. They constantly shift sideways and often fall off of the earbud. I am not sure if this loose gasket is the reason why the headphones have difficulty sensing when it is in your ear.

R36DXR094RZRKY,B09CGM1BWH,4.0 out of 5 stars Good sound quality. Basic ANC. Weird case and fit.,Manuel G.,4,"I like the sound. It's honestly quite good. The ANC is functional enough but isn't great compared to something like airpods. Transparency mode is very quiet and sounds low quality. The earbuds pullout the silicon tips (invert the cone) often and the wings usually rotate off the earbud so it breaks the seal which messes up the ANC. The earbuds have to be put into the case backwards (will make sense once you have them in your hands) which is super strange. Larger wings will make the case catch onto the wings occasionally which should not happen either. Overall it's a good attempt although many things should be improved and probably could be with just a software update. I will keep trying them out but might eventually return them if I finally decide whether they are worth the money or not. Right now I'm on the fence. Airpods take you to another world in terms of noise cancellation. These lack a lot in that field.Update (about 1 month): I've been using these pretty frequently and I can say that the small issues these earbuds have are becoming rather bothersome. Specifically the eartips reversing frequently when I pull them out of my ears, and the wings rotating off the in ear sensor which forces you to orient them correctly again otherwise they won't play any sound. The sound quality is good but the ANC still isn't great. I will most likely return these and bite the bullet for some airpods.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2023",AGNG2MU6FVA6RM4UQT4Q6TGRME7A,True,2,Color: Midnight Black

After a couple of years of using the over-ears, I was in a situation where I was likely to need to be able to answer calls at work while also being able to hear what is going on around me - so I forced myself to hunt for some earbuds.These were not the first I tried. I started with a pair of Tribit Flybuds3 that I was using daily for about a year. They were /fine/ but were confirming my annoyances with earbuds as a whole. When I started to tire of the poor shaping and weight of those, I decided that since I was using them daily, I was going to look for something more premium.These were a great choice. I like them, the Bluetooth technology has gotten better and these are leveraging the best parts of it, in my opinion. The battery life is really good for my uses - I probably get about 6-7 hours on each earbud of intermittent daily playback, and the charging times are really solid. Noise cancellation is the best I've experienced in any headphone, let alone earbud - real cancellation, not just sounding like its pumping air into your ear.Two largest complaints are that you sometimes have to take care to ensure that the bud is charging in the case - the contact points can be finnicky so I have, in the last year of owning them, run into maybe a dozen times that I didn't seat it all the way and so my bud did not charge at all - but since it charges fast, its not a huge issue. Second, the software is not absolutely flawless, but its more than serviceable.If I end up needing another pair for any reason or to give as a gift, I'm picking these. And if they ever release a ""liberty 5"" in this same sort of form factor, I'm ordering.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2023",AHBY4E7F32PMZI6FZZGWQTCK55LQ,True,2,

I am amazed at how good these sound.- The case is really neat.- Bluetooth setup is a breeze.- Ambience mode is excellent, allowing me to clearly hear my coworkers while listening to music.- Comes with a large assortment of various sized tips and wings.- The soundcore app has a lot of useful features and amazing customization options.- Decent battery life.Cons:- The most annoying con is the inconsistency in the volume. The volume is fine when you first use them but after putting them in the case for a period of time the volume level will be much quieter. The device volume level will not have changed but the earbuds are noticeably much quieter. The only way to fix this is to have the volume assigned to a double tap gesture on the earbud and max it and then adjust the level on the device to the appropriate level.- The left earbud randomly stops working at times until I put them both back in the case.- The noise canceling is almost non-existent.- The earbuds seem to randomly pause for no reason. I use these at work for a few hours each day, off and on, and they pause about 3 or so times randomly.- Even though these come with an assortment of tips and wings I can't seem to find a perfect fit. I constantly have to push them in and twist them until they sound right again after any kind of movement.Edit: I end up having to return these. The incredible sound just wasn't enough to compensate for all of the frustrating issues.","Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2023",AFXDGDU6FF6DFYFEMQ2AMDVYTZ6A,True,0,Color: Midnight Black

The only drawback is they just not small enough for my tiny ear canals. I could feel the angles and edges of the hard plastic parts against my ear canal with the smallest rubber cones installed, and any of the larger rubber cones included were too large to even fit in my ear. After trying them for a weekend, they just had to be returned.I'm sticking with over-the-ear type headphones for now, and I can solidly recommend Anker's Q45 headphones as best of the bunch. I bought both these Liberty 3 Pro and the Space Q45 during an Amazon/Anker sale for just at $100 each in October 2023.","Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2023",AGNOWHXXHDTQ7CB6QEVR6B5YH4BA,True,1,

The product looks good and fits well.Sound quality is pretty good as well.I do notice that the noise cancellation is a bit finicky and sometimes emphasized the outside noise instead of suppress it. Also, the headphone will periodically stop playing sound although the phone continues to play the sound. The video/audio file does not pause. It just disconnects the sound for about 5 to 10 seconds at times and automatically starts to play again, almost as if the audio connection lost connectivity.All in all, I am rating this about a 5 to 6 out of 10.","Reviewed in the United States May 17, 2024",AFPU3LJWYWEKI5WQOOAM63PKYCTA,True,0,Color: Midnight Black

R14CW53K5QWT5N,B09CGM1BWH,"3.0 out of 5 stars Better Sounding than it's predacessor, but also inferior in multiple ways",Robert S.,3,"I lost my second set of Soundcore Liberty 2 Earbuds so the Liberty 3 buds seemed like a sensical replacement. They were not.MusicThese sound fuller and richer than the Soundcore Liberty Pro 2 buds. Listening to a jazz track with rich base low tones with a simultaneous high pitched cymbal is a true pleasure. It's about as good as you can get in a wireless earbud. This is the best thing I can say about them.Phone CallsSame as above. These are the best buds I’ve ever used for phone conversations. My wife can berate me about all the things I did wrong in super high def while I'm driving home from the grocery store, and she said when I try to defend myself, I sound very clear, but I’m still wrong.ANCThe noise cancellation is nice. Anker says it draws more battery consumption but I haven’t found this problematic. I am getting over 4 hours with ANC and that’s plenty for my lifestyle.VolumeThese are plenty loud for phone calls, but why did they cap the volume for music? These are subjectively 30% quieter at max volume than the Liberty Air 2! I need a bit more volume at the gym or a busy airport terminal. The Liberty Air 2’s were perfect for this. This is a big disappointment.Control ButtonsThere are no “buttons” to speak of on these buds. Using the Soundscore Mobile App (iOS or Android), you can assign different tasks to the left and right ear buds by using a touching gesture to the exterior of the bud. This is great in concept, but the reality is that I end up stopping my music or ending a phone call accidently when I try to adjust the buds in my ear. This was a bad design. The Liberty Air 2’s have a physical button the you push making it virtually impossible to accidentally press.Charging CaseNo problems with charging. Love the USB-C Port. It’s a perfect pocket size.ConclusionAnker stripped the good parts of the Liberty 2 Pro and added some better speakers. Is the sound improved enough to justify keeping them? I don’t think so. I plan on returning these and waiting for a future release to see if any of these problems are addressed. The Liberty 3 Pros are great buds, but I can’t get over the inadequate maximum volume and the virtual control buttons. I am an Anker loyalist, so I will always gravitate to their products over competitors. This one just didn’t do it for me.

R3CW8X23HDK4ZB,B09CGM1BWH,3.0 out of 5 stars Not good for calls except in quiet rooms,Sylvia,3,"Pros:1. Actually fit my small ears and ear canals and didn't fall out while walking or sitting (I didn't try running). Though I did feel them very slowly start getting loose while doing yoga over a half hour, especially in poses like Down Dog. I did adjust once, but they never fell out. (Note, my inner ears can get a little sweaty.) It was nice having that immersive music while doing yoga.2. I can wear my glasses and face mask, no problem. Unlike the hook-over-ear buds I had been using.3. I appreciate the fitting test in the app so I know how to properly wear the buds.4. Music and ANC are great, as other reviews have mentioned. However, I almost only listen to podcasts and want to take calls with the earbuds, and I don't care so much about listening to music.Cons:1. ""6 microphones and an AI-noise reduction algorithm filter out background noises and enhance your voice in real time so you can be heard clearly."" Bogus, like so many other earbuds claim but can't deliver. And I watched a few YouTube videos where people demonstrate how various ear buds sound in busy, loud places, before settling on trying these earbuds. Actually, in a quiet room, at home, they seem to work well. My work colleague that I normally call daily, out of the blue asked why I sound so much louder and clearer. I usually wear my Bose 700 noise cancelling headphones. The first time I made a call with the Soundcore 3 Pros, I got that positive comment. However, when I go to a place moderately or even barely loud, like a grocery store on a weekday, the person on the other end of the call has a hard time hearing me. I hear comments like, ""What?"" ""Say that again?"" and ""Dang, I could hear the person walking by you much louder than I could hear you."" Though they didn't hear the soft background music the store was playing at least. So I switch back to using my Pixel 6 microphone instead of these earbuds. Note, I updated the app, I played around with a lot of settings, ANC, went to the online troubleshooting website. No help.And that one con is why I'm returning these headphones. For earbuds that cost over $100 and claim to have clear calls that filter out background noise, I expected more. The biggest reason I got these earbuds was for those clear calls.","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2023",AGIHQX4I6FUB4NEI3TWL63EL6WLA,True,2,

Even after 2 years they still give me 4-5 hrs of use outside the case. I like how they sound and I have never heard anyone saying they can’t hear me clearly on Zoom or on phone. I have used them while driving, running and walking.

R2YE3QOLSJLQVO,B09CGM1BWH,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, but WON'T stay in ears. NOT for runner, hiker, biker",Jack L.,3,"My three requirements for earbuds: Good sound quality, resist outside signal interference, MUST stay in ears.Soundcore (part of Anker) is an excellent company with great US based tech support and I own many of their speakers, cords and charging blocks. These earbuds pass the first two requirements, but badly fail the third. Despite the detail engineering they put into many earwigs and silicone canal tips, none of these kept them in my ears when running, hiking, biking or even slower movement in my home. Their engineers put too much weight on the outside of these buds, perhaps to offer the great sound and noise cancellation; but without tails to better offset weight they gradually loosen and fall out. As an active person, I won't use buds that I have to adjust every 40-60 yards on a trail to stop them from falling out. I owned several pairs of OFUSHO earbuds that met all my requirements with great battery life, but the batteries finally died and they're no longer sold anywhere I could find. I have a new pair of ""on the ear"" buds (bone conduction) with clips over the ears that come tomorrow. I suspect the sound will not be as great because sound waves are not trapped in ear canal, but I'll have to compromise sound for buds that stay on my ears. Liberty 3 Pro earbuds are NOT a good choice for a very active person.","Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2024",AFQNIJVAXJFWXSAKE55OUASUKKKA,True,1,

They sound absolutely amazing! the highs and lows are all there.B, they have multiple fitting attachments so most people will find it comfortable in their ears.3, setting up and connection was easy and I didn't experience and problems unless I walked away too far from the phone.D, Changing settings through touch was non-problematic and was very responsive.5) They wireless charging case is a nice touch.Now, what can be improved:1) The Battery life with transparency on was not very long, low battery warning at 3hours. Because of this, I had to use one earbud at a time so I would be able to use them nonstop without having to recharge them through the case.B) When using only one earbud at a time many of the sound setting(through the app) were not available.3)When using one earbud at a time, I noticed that the uncovered ear was louder, so the transparency mode is not loud/strong enough. It would be nice to have an option though the app to adjust the transparency volume. Also, all earbuds have a problem of having an effect on our own voices when speaking with someone(sounds muffled). it would be nice to have this corrected, possible by turning up the treble?D, the case is so so, I'd rather the snap lid and ease of just popping in the buds for charging. The case on this has a sliding lid that seems a bit thin and easy to break. Also, I have to adjust the buds to connect correctly inside or they would not charge.5) I listen to a lot of audio books, it would be nice to have an option to be able to go back 10 seconds through the ear buds.All in all, I do like them and think they are definitely worth getting. Just the sound quality alone is worth it. The other things are just an inconvenience.

RCB2LAISXX5NO,B09CGM1BWH,5.0 out of 5 stars What the ... HECK?!,C. Wood,5,"I own a cheap pair of Soundpeats and an expensive pair of Google Pixel buds. For the money, the Soundpeats are good. The same can be said for the Google Pixel Pro buds, which are much more expensive but are also worth the cash. However, these Anker Liberty buds are surprisingly good. So good, they may set the bar in a whole new level. They are quite comfortable, which contributes to my criteria for a good fit (don't wiggle, good seal, don't fall out, don't cause ear pain). I spent several minutes completing the sound calibration in their app, which is slick and easy to use. After the sound calibration (which revealed my old ears are unable to hear certain frequencies), I was astonished how clear and clean the music sounded. I skipped around my library enjoying music from various genres and artists, enjoying the rich sound. The transparency mode is certainly better than the Google Pixel Pro buds. Don't get me wrong, I like my Pixel buds, but they are no longer my favorite buds. I only rated a 4 for battery life because I haven't had them a full 24 hours yet, so I can't rightfully evaluate the overall performance of the battery in either the buds or the case. I'll report back if I need to change that rating. Overall, these are stellar earbuds! I appreciate the app design, I love the form factor of the case and buds ... I'm going to carry these in my pocket as part of my EDC!UPDATE: After owning these buds for about 6 months I can say the battery life is better than I expected and I'd rate it 5-stars. However, one drawback has become apparent. I cannot get the earbuds to stay in my ears. Over the course of about 30 minutes they slowly loosen and eventually will fall out if I don't reposition them. I've tried a couple solutions, including various sized ear pieces and wiping my ears before I insert the earbuds. I even tried washing and drying my ears, which was a hassle, but still didn't work. I am able to get the earbuds positioned firmly and they sound amazing, but they slowly lose their fit making me concerned that I may drop one. Still, these are the best earbuds I've ever used and I will not give them up.","Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2022",AGF2IEKZZWRUE66HQSQBLTWI5ZYA,True,2,

I used to wear Sony WF-XB700 (sadly I lost mine), and they discontinued them (by far best ear buds for thumpy base I've ever used). So I was on the hunt for some good ear buds with loads of thumpy base. I tried offerings from Sennheiser, JBL, Jabra, Sony and Now Anker. I returned all the other pairs, they all had meh sound out of the box, the base was not thumpy regardless of what EQ settings I used. The Sennheiser CX Plus True Wireless were the worst of the bunch.These liberty 3 Pros are just Wonderful. They sounded great right out of the box and all of the things you can do in the app actually make them sound better. I find them extremely comfortable. And for all the people that say that they're not great for working out, I beg to differ, mine are super secure, not overly tight, and I can do HITT training and anything else and they stay nice and snug. The touch controls aren't annoying, and don't accidentally go off. I've had zero connectivity issues with them. The mic quality is wonderful. You can use each ear bud individually if you want.

Sounds balance, bass and volume are all on point. Super, super satisfied with the sound quality.As always, the full experience can only be obtained once the product is in-hand. A review can only convey so much.There's a couple things to keep in mind with these, the touch controls offer all the options most people are looking for. But they are very sensitive. If you're like me, then you adjust your earbuds fairly often during workouts. These buds will register touches very, very easily. Stopping the music, and toggling the ambient noise cancelling over and over. This is not fun.The other significant nitpick to mention is that as I write this review, Bixby had been activated 4 times (make that 5 times) while the buds are in the charging case, closed.I've adjusted the buds and played with the ear gels to no avail. I've also checked firmware, which is up to date.I've had the Liberty 3's for two weeks and this has happened twice.

I'm not quite an audiophile as I'm on a budget where I try to go for the best sound value around $100-200. Personally, when taking audio quality listening tests, I can't tell any difference over 128k audio on any piece of equipment I've owned, but I'm picky if quality is below that.They are very comfortable to wear for several hours at a time, I would keep them in all day if they never ran out of battery.

I listen to music while walking my dog on suburban car-dependent streets with no sidewalks and I can hear cars coming from behind me.ANC is great for certain sounds, especially brown or white noise, I couldn't even hear my dishwasher and had to double check that I turned it on. I live with an older person who always has the TV on loud and I can still make out the TV with only ANC on, but not with ANC+Music or ANC+rain noise.I like the case, but you have to confirm with the light to know both earbuds are charging, sometimes the contacts get dirty and won't make a connection.Touch controls, I changed all the controls and they work pretty great. I had to get used to double tapping as it would sometimes register as a single tap, but I've learned how to use it better.Bluetooth range seems good, working through the inner walls of my house, but not the outer concrete or into the garage. Connection drops momentarily sometimes, maybe once every few hours, reconnecting automatically without intervention.I love that I can have two devices connected simultaneously, my PC and phone, automatically using whichever one is playing sound/music.

R21A5RD9ZUZQPV,B09CGM1BWH,4.0 out of 5 stars Overall it's okay,Jessica J,4,"They have great sound, they're small, convenient, and portable. Noise cancellation is excellent. I don't love the transparency mode though; If too much wind or my hair rubs against it too much it will shut off and go back to normal mode. The transparent sound is decent but you have to turn down your music, or whatever you're watching, to the point of barely being able to hear it or just pause it so you can hear the external sound more clearly.The thing that bothers me the most is when you're only wearing one earbud the sound still registers like you're wearing two? Like the sound is only in both earbuds and when you only have one in, you're only getting half of the sound. Example: You're listening to a song that has split music; the vocals in one earbud and the instrumentals in the other, if you only have one earbud in your ear and the other in the case, it still only comes through one ear thus only getting the vocals and nothing else. I'd love to know if I can change this because it is pretty irritating sometimes.The touch sensors take some getting used to, the slightest pressure on them triggers the sensor and it will pause or skip whatever you're listening to, depending on how many times it registers taps.The rubber earpiece moves when you adjust it into place after the first few uses, which can be annoying sometimes but it's manageable.Overall I like them, they just take some getting used to. I feel like the sport X10s might be better, but I'm not sure. I do enjoy the customization through the app, although the hearID does seem off. I personally don't use it, just the normal mode and transparency mode. I think they're a great alternative for the price, and the quality is good!

I also own a pair of Liberty Pro 2 buds, so I was very pre-disposed to like these. Unfortunately, they aren't the right product for me and I'm returning them.First, the good: they sound excellent! Punchy, bright, with lots of bass. Overall, a really good sound profile. They aren't too big in the ears and have great battery life. Especially at under $100 if you catch them on sale, there's great value here from a sound and features perspective.The not so good: the way they look. The Liberty 2 buds were in a nice matte black soft-touch rubber case, and the buds looked great in black plastic, and a dark grey satin front to each bud. These? They are garish and ugly. I ordered the grey; the case has a shiny light grey satin plastic finish that is quite slippery. They did make the case smaller, which I appreciate, but I prefer the design of the previous one in terms of materials. The buds themselves are even more garish, with a glossy silver plastic face that is hugely reflective. It shows fingerprints like crazy, which you'll have as you use the touch-sensitive surface to control them. The touch controls are iffy at best; sometimes they just don't register touches properly. I prefer the reliable little buttons on the Pro 2 buds.The bad: in the few hours that I've used them, there are bursts of loud static that occur and it's quite painful and shocking when it happens. It seems random to me, but it's happened several times and it's inexcusable for a product like this to have such a fatal flaw.Overall, I'm disappointed in Anker for releasing a product like this because I hold them to a high standard and know they can do better. Perhaps the Liberty Pro 4 will be worth considering?","Reviewed in the United States August 26, 2023",AG4TNMGWFXUNI5TZANSMQHPYOXEA,True,0,

RLQPQ0FSE9I07,B09CGM1BWH,4.0 out of 5 stars Phenomenal sound!,Rick Martinez,4,I’ve tried many earbuds over the years and these are by far the best I’ve ever used with iPhone. Much better sound quality than Apple's best in my opinion. Crisp highs and deep lows and detail I never knew existed in my music and the app has EQ presets from Grammy winning music producers but also allows you to customize your own settings. Only real drawback are the wings. They are fragile and tend to wear out over time so you will need to replace them at some point. I had to order replacements directly from the manufacturer since I couldn’t find them here. The wing tips are the only reason I did not give the Liberty Pro 3 a 5 star rating.,"Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2023",AEUZM5TN7GJXLSNVPGJB4VBMPJLA,True,1,Color: Midnight Black

I did a lot of research and reviews and prices were all over the place. One thing I didn't want to do was spend $300 on earbuds and not like them. I have purchased several pairs from $20 to $75 before, one being a well known brand. What I learned is that noise cancelling is very important if you want to use the earbuds to mow the lawn, (I have an electric lawn mower) which is when I use them most. These have very good sound quality for the price but noise cancelling is not so good. My $75 earbuds work much better at noise cancelling but don't have the sound quality. For general music listening these are great! Another thing, these Soundcore earbuds don't like to pair to my TV sets either so for that, I use my cheap buds as my Jabra's don't like TV's either.

I no longer experience a high pitch buzzing sound when the volume hits 90% or more. Sound quality is really good with a nice V-Shape EQ. However I will have to get used to that wireless earbuds will not have the same volume level that wired headphones can produce. Overall these are quality earbuds with good ANC characteristics. A recommended purchase.Wow, after reading many of the reviews on the Liberty Pro 3 I was super excited. Once I tried them my excitement turned to disappointment. Pretty much most of the glowing reviews on Amazon, Best Buy and YouTube mentioned the loudness of these Liberty 3 Pro earphones. I like my music nice and loud and these earphones are a huge letdown. I have several earphones made by Google and Samsung and they are all much louder than these by about 50% with solid noise cancellation. I plugged in my wired headphones and the volume was nice and loud.I hooked these up to my Pixel 4a 5G, downloaded the Soundcore app. I updated the FW to 4.93 fired up some music and nothing mind blowing with the volume. I tried different settings in the Soundcore app to see if there would be a difference with ANC on or off and nada, not that much a difference in volume. I did notice when I set the volume to its highest setting that the left earbud introduced a high freq buzz. Either I am missing something on the Soundcore app or these might be defective.I paired these with my iPad and the highest level volume was about equal to the Pixel 4a 5G. I have several other earbuds that have higher volume levels than the Liberty 3 Pros so I may have to send them back.","Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2022",AF2GITXLXFV6GQQVWASFQSRWGN4A,True,1,

I am not sure if I have strangely shaped ears but I've tried so many different types of earbuds and the only ones that worked for me were the Galaxy Buds+. However, I've lost maybe 3 or 4 pairs of those and they no longer manufacture them so I've had to go hunting.I've tried every Samsung earbud offering, JBL's, Sony's, Apple Airpods, none of them worked well for me or fit in my ear nicely. I read several reviews ranting and raving about these earbuds and I especially paid attention to those claiming that these were better than the Galaxy Buds+.The packaging was on another level. Comparable to what you'd expect from Apple except even better. These come with 4 sets of tips so there's no room for error in terms of sizing. The buds themselves are incredibly lightweight even though they appear larger in the photos. The case is unbelievably cool. It illuminates your dirty earwaxed up earbuds but this serves as a reminder to keep them clean. I've never really had any trouble with the case other than the constant desire to continuously open and close them because it is very satisfying.The sound quality is great, I think the microphone isn't great but I've only taken a few calls on it). Bass is good, you can apply a custom EQ as well.I docked a star because one of the earbuds is unable to hold a charge. I will be using them both and after 1 hour, one earbud is at like 90% and the other is asking me to put it back on the charger. I tried cleaning it and everything and can't get it to charge properly again. Other than this one issue, they've been great. I'll just have to buy another pair I guess.","Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2022",AFV2WDVDD4WZIZMAO4IDLJLMTEJA,True,2,Color: Midnight Black

Around that same time in 2023 I started noticing the case took a lot less time to charge up, but was not holding the same capacity to be able to charge the earbuds numerous times on a case charge. I noticed in December of 2023 that the earbuds themselves not don't get the typical 6-8 hours of listening time per charge as well that they were getting for at least 8-9 months that I owned them.Of course they are out of warranty now, and I don't expect Soundcore will do anything for me, but when buying earbuds I do not expect battery capacity issues to start creeping into the picture before at least 2 years of using them. In reality compared to an average use, I doubt I used the average amount of time that most users would use them during this year plus time frame that I have owned them. So if you are a heavier user than average or even average user of earbuds be warned your battery case and earbud capacity may suffer. Hopefully if this happens to you it happens during the warranty period and not afterwards like mine did.","Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2024",AHHWSVXTIYS3RJ5Z25CL5JA4DHDA,True,0,Color: Midnight Black

To my pleasant surprise, they are incredible. When I got them in the mail, I at first thought they sent me an empty box, they are so light. Mine were already charged and ready to go when I received them. It came in a white colored box cover but when you removed this there was a very sharp black box which you could actually use as a present, it was this nice. Opening the box, you had three smaller boxes, one for the strap and usb. One for the earpieces, and the last for the minimal instructions. The Ear buds themselves were contained in the main box itself. This was a very classy presentation, and I was excited to try this out.Connection was quite easy and the clarity... Amazing, the music felt like it was inside my head, and I could hear every word within the songs. [As a side note, I realized I misunderstood some song lyrics for years.] As a veteran, and in my 60's I have some hearing loss, but I tell you truly, listening to music through this device is incredible. For the price, this is a steal. I cannot comment on battery life at this time because I only have had these for 24hrs. Lastly, I thought they would fall out because of how light they were but incredibly I could go on a brisk walk, and they didn't budge at all, very nice.Postives: Very inexpensive for what you are getting. A great presentation box, beautiful color [Mine is Candy Apple Red], Ease of use, Very Light, Comfortable and the Clarity is amazing for what I paid for it.Negatives: The only downsides to me where the instructions that came in the box. I had to go to the internet and type Raycon instructions to find out how to actually use them. The only other possible negative was choosing the correct earpiece for your ears. They are small and are really easy to drop and lose. They are also a little difficult to actually put on the earbuds themselves, but this is true of all earbuds I have used in the past. My recommendation is to try the pair that is already on the buds, if they fall out, they are too big for your inner ear. I had to use the smallest set to get them to fit correctly.","Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2024",AE65XNQETGZ2LEDHFJZZFOSLOXUQ,True,94,

These don’t hurt my ears like the AirPods Pro after a long wear time. The only thing the APP has over this is the full noise cancellation mode which can cancel out a power washer, these still muffle outside noise well enough (I’m just using foam for anything needing ear protection for now until I get some money for the nicer raycon offerings) that they are noise canceling for me.These connected super fast, very easily, their sound comes across great. The different modes offer a nice little EQ switch if one of the few songs I want bass boosted comes on the shuffle.Switching between devices is much, much easier than the pods. It is such a hassle with my Apple airpods pro to get them connected to my phone if I am anywhere near my laptop. It’s easier to walk outside and try to open and close the case than trying to do it via any menu or in-built options.With these Raycons I can literally just go to the thing I want them connected to, click the little “connect” button and about 2 seconds later I have that thing connected to my earbuds without having to put them in the case and fumble with all of that.Connecting them to my TV has given me so much more freedom because I’m a night owl and now I can leave off the subtitles to focus on whatever thing I’m working on. I can walk away and not miss anything. I can also have something inputting to the tv and just use the buds for that sound as well, which is basically impossible to do with the Apple AirPodsThey are the perfect size to fit the opening of my ears, way more comfortable than the pods.Also, they haven’t gotten out of sync yet. One in, take out the other and they’re matched perfectly. Swap around, whatever you do they stay correct for stereo sound. Apple air pods pro will often get out of sync with each other or even worse go mono because they can’t figure out how to communicate with whatever device they’re trying to pair with. Really pathetic on apples part, Raycon blows them out of the water in that aspectBattery life is great, I get through so many episodes of things and I usually manage to get them charging again before I drain them fully lolAfter this most recent iPhone os update the AirPods are even more wonky: trying to connect to the phone while they’re in the case and it’s closed 😂🤣 I am so, so glad I got these Raycons and can’t wait to get my next pair","Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2023",AH42CWEACUMT6LSFTG57KRHHW5JQ,True,130,

This is an added plus for me cause I can actually sleep with them in with no issue.Battery life - so far battery life seems above and beyond other brands was stuck in a delayed flight for 2 hrs plus the 4 hr flight time and still had 40% battery life according to my phone.Sound - great sound and 3 different options to choose from depending on your preference or music choice.Price: Cheaper than most comparable brands.Cons:The charging case - the charging case is small and compact, but the lid is very thin and I feel like it could easily be broken off if you aren’t careful with it.Awareness mode, I feel like there is still some noise isolation in awareness mode and I sometimes don’t feel as though I’m as present in the environment as I should be with that mode enabled.Fit: while I don’t have an issue I can see people with smaller ears may have an issue with the retention of the buds in their ears.No tracking: I get these aren’t integrated into the various tracking apps that phones these days have, but it would be nice if it were integrated cause these things are small in their case.","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AEZWOV2DA5KHY7LUJE2LQN7E6HNQ,True,2,
R1LFS8RDVSK7IZ,B0CTD56NJ2,5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite ear buds!!!,SuzyLane,5,"Got the blue ones. These were a hand-me-down from my stepson. He said they would hurt his ears ""after a while."" A while is approximately 1hr-10hrs, 'cause he used them while gaming. Other than that, he loved them. Did a lot of research prior to buying and these seemed the best for him.I use them for listening to Pandora, while walking the dog, as well as using just one, so I can hear myself playing acoustic bass, and singing along with whatever's playing on them. I used to design loudspeakers for Polk Audio in the mid 80's till mid-90's. Done my fair share of critical listening, and won't buy or use anything else, regardless of price. Polks are simply the best.I love my lil buds!!! I've used others in the past: JBL - nice, and quality-made. Motorola (w. headband) - pure junk - stay away. Sony (both wired and wireless) actually my 2nd favorite - but for the price, excellent. Monster over head big phones - liked them way better than Beats' shrill, and boomy sound, but, couldn't get a good fit, w their buds. KOSS wired el cheapos - great value, and audiophile-quality sound, but, very flimsy, and not as good as these, soundwise, for my personal taste. Koss buds - ok sound and mic, terrible build quality. Polk Audio buds - best I've ever heard of ANY headset - and worth the price if you can find them, slightly used. Mackie - meh - loud. Bose buds - excellent, but, terrible warranty and cust. service. Bose over-ears - nothing spectacular. Sennheiser - love mine, and they're 40 years old. Modded to fit inside Howard Leight V3, over-ear noise cancelling phones - and they're my in-house go-to for accurate sound reproduction, amateur recording, and over-all listening. Sennheiser wireless w. transmitter - outstanding for late-night watching or gaming. Almost completely silent to others', nearby, when in use. Very accurate surround sound reproduction. Slightly expensive, but, worth it. Nothing else compares in this price range. - Need a lot of AA batteries to use. Also tried other brands, but, none were as nice as these.The bass in these is incredible. You can ""feel"" the subsonic frequencies. No other buds were able to replicate lower bass frequencies as well as these. Not even close.Clarity of sound. You can hear every nuance of the recording. Every song sounds better, and I've discovered sounds and parts of songs, which I've never heard through ANY listening device. Not overhead earphones, and I'm talking expensive studio-quality gear, costing 100x more than these lil buds. You can hear every instrument, in its ""location"" on the stage, or studio, if different. Even the player's fingertips when playing, or using other plucking techniques. You can hear the singer's breath while singing in the song. Amazing big-room, studio, hall, or live concert sound reproduction. The Who's Quadrophenia is like nothing I've heard before, regardless of system, period. I've tried all the different sound options, but, being a bassist, I stick w/ the Bass setting. It's louder, and actually clearer. They've never distorted on me, except through a generic free smartphone. Sound varies somewhat through PCs, laptops, and other cell phones, but it always sounds good.The color is nice. They match my car's color, lol. Quality build. I've dropped them, sat on them, stepped on them, and went a whole summer of high temps, sweat, and rain. A few charging issues, due to dust in the charging port, and my failure to use them as instructed. You can also charge them wirelessly!!! Bluetooth works every time, quickly and flawlessly. I, usually, get about a month, before it's time to recharge the base. This depends on charger, charging method, and amount of daily use.All that at a fair price... some would even say, inexpensive, compared w. other 'phones which cost WAY more.

I have had these for about a week and a half so far and I have only had 1 problem with them. That problem is them disconnecting/audio bugging for a bit before I have to reconnect them, but that usually doesn't take longer than 25 seconds.They have a bunch of features with them such as an awareness mode that let's you hear your music with bass still and hear most things around you. You can't hear everything with this mode, but it is alot better than not hearing anything. You can also change the modes for the type of audio that you want to hear. You can boost the bass, balance everything out, etc.The only thing that I would improve with these headphones is the microphone. If you are in a call with someone, they can understand you clearly, but the mic quality isn't the best.

Packaging is nice, comes with a brief, clearly written user manual which I used right away to see how to change the sound options. I use a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, and I took these buds out of the package, directly out of the case and put them right in. The default female voice told me they were powered on right away, sounding in both ears, in the order i put them in. Opened bluetooth options on my phone and they were already listed as ""Raycon Everyday Buds."" I touched the name and they connected right off without any issue whatsoever. Hit play on my music, and I love the sound. I just opened them today, so I'm waiting to see how these endure before giving full stars.The button in each bud is a physical push button, a bubble that clicks. I like it because the sweaty strap from my bike helmet won't press it inadvertently like my old buds that just had ""touch control."" You can't see the bud when you reach up to touch it, so it's always a game of fumbling with where to touch it and how many ""touches"" would register. Especially when on the mountain bike, that frustrated me, but maybe you like it (wierdo)...Sound quality:I love all three modes. ""Balanced, Bass and Pure"" they all sound good while bringing in their individual strengths. For piano pieces, like Paul Cardall or Ludivico Eiunadi, Pure Sound is precise. For Van Halen, Nightwish, and Godsmack, Balanced sound and Bass modes are excellent. It's all subjective anyway, but I can hear the details and fairly crisp sounds.Awareness Mode:This is my first time trying buds that have a mode where they claim to allow you to hear ambient noise around you while still enjoying the music. Raycon calls it ""Awareness Mode"". It works, but not as i had hoped. In my mind, I had anticipated being able to speak while listening to my music and hear my voice and others' clearly through the electronic mic instead of through jawbone vibrations like when you plug your ears with your fingers and speak. These buds can do that, but you can only hear it faintly, and I find myself wishing I could turn up that volume. But if I turn it up, only the music gets louder and the ambient sounds are left behind as the music grows in volume. The ambient sound volume is constant, and only works well if I turn the music off. Which is a disapponting feature because then what's the point? Without the music, I might as well remove the buds right? All buds claim to have powerful noise canceling, but what I'm hoping for is exactly the opposite, I want to hear my music and all the ambient sounds while biking, running, and working at my computer. It should be like hearing the world around me but with cool music that nobody else can hear. Why isn't this an option? Maybe I'm the wierdo.The fit is okay... It comes with multiple gel sizes. The default sizes were a bit tight, so I downsized them by one, and they are comfortable for about 15 minutes then I have to push them in again. Not quite settled on which size of gel I should be using. This shouldn't be that difficult but...UPDATE: 8/24/22I've had them for over a month now. Still working as they did they day I opened them.*The container charges in just a couple hours*The longest I have had these in is about 5 hours, my ears became fatigued from the fit before the battery ran out while I was backpacking. The buds charged up and container still had more than 50%*PHONE CALLS: I haven't had problems hearing clear audio from the phone calls. When I ask the other caller how I sound they have told me I'm difficult to hear well. If i turn off Bluetooth and speak directly into the phone they report my sound as being much better. Not impressed with the microphone quality. But I have had no problems at all hearing the other caller clearly.*I have not yet had any connection problems with my phone*I still am disappointed with the Awareness Mode. It's very underwhelming compared to my daughter's Jabra Elite Active 75 earbuds with the same feature. Those are significantly better in this regard.*I wear these while mountain biking, they stay in fine, but I don't bomb down the mountain either.*I really wish I had the ability to adjust the equalizer settings but it's fixed in stone. The app is a complete joke, no functionality at all. No my friend, if you want to adjust the equalizer, these are not for you. I do wish I could adjust the bass to be more pronounced, and the highs to be a bit sharper.12/2/2022 UPDATE: over 1 year ownership..I still have these and they still work as described above, they hold charge forever. But at this point I'm ready for a different pair just because of the phone call quality and the weak awareness mode. I've also found that I can't remember how to use all the features because the push button functions aren't very intuitive, and no app to use for adjustments. I can answer a phone call, one push in either ear, but the quality is still reported as ""difficult to hear."" I'm going to be buying a different brand.You should buy these if:-You don't care about the awareness Mode-You just want something that holds charge very well and will last a long time.-Plays music with clear quality and have no desire to mess with sound settings.-You want something with rock solid, reliable, connectivity.You should not buy these if:-You want to talk on the phone a lot-You want to hear the details of what's going on around you clearly while still listening to loud music-You like to adjust the equalizer","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2022",AEALUFESZ2ILQK6QHBIASNCGQFMQ,True,768,
RA56J5XVZRA48,B0CTD56NJ2,3.0 out of 5 stars Somehow sound worse than the 2023 edition. Awful connectivity issues,Dusty4341,3,"*This review is for the 2024 version of Raycon Everyday Earbuds. I find it annoying that the reviews for the 2023 version are included here. Most people in their reviews do not differentiate between which set they own, which makes it frustrating to find reviews for the 2024 version. I find this somewhat deceptive on Raycon's part, as it obviously impacts the overall rating. Having said all that:POSITIVES- Earbuds remain firmly in place while sitting- Solid battery life. Really only needed to charge them every two days- Good sound quality for the priceNEGATIVES- An annoying amount of connectivity issues. Earbuds would regularly cut out both during calls and listening to music. In addition, despite my iPhone knowing I own them, oftentimes when taking them out of the case I'll hearing ""pairing mode."" Almost every time this happens, my iPhone does not recognize them, so I have to repeatedly put them back in the case until my phone recognizes the earbuds- Earbuds come with three different sound settings. However, the difference between them is negligible- More often than not, even when I'd put the earbuds back in their case they would still be paired to my iPhone. So, I'd have to go under Bluetooth settings and manually disconnect them- The bass sounds artificial (not true bass), slightly muddy. Personally, I feel the overall sound quality of these is slightly worse than the 2023 version- Regardless of which size earbud tips used, it's like these things are on a personal mission to fall out of my ears. If I go jogging, I'm constantly having to readjust them so they don't fall out. And if I'm doing some light chores around the house, it's the same. While washing some dishes, the left earbud fell out and nearly landed in a bowl of water. Fortunately, I was able to lightly swat it onto the counterAdmittedly, I have high standards when it comes to earbuds due to how often I use them, as well as being a self-professed audiophile. Decided to try these out since my 2023 earbuds are getting older, and quickly realized the 'upgrade' wasn't worth it and will be returning them. To be clear, I've owned WAYY worse earbuds before, and if you can grab these while on sale I wouldn't fault you for it. However, when factoring in all the aforementioned issues, which far outweigh the positives, they simply are not a good option (for me; your results may vary).A week after purchasing these, I decided to splurge on a $180 pair of earbuds from a highly reputable company. I can honestly say I was floored by how much better the sound was; incredible bass that doesn't drown the singing out, excellent treble, and some of the crispest sound I've ever heard.Again, if you're looking for a cheaper option, even with their flaws these aren't terrible earbuds. But for athletic types like me, you can do way better. 3/5, but closer to a 2.5.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2024",AGX2MHQWCCATODOEH4DTJ5VPNGUQ,True,9,
R27TV504DW6UCH,B0CTD56NJ2,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Earbuds, With Some Slight Issues",Ryan Baldwin,4,"Let me first say that these earbuds are comfortable and have great sound. The quality seems premium (despite being made of plastic) and I like the design mashup of gloss and matte surfaces. Still, I have a couple small gripes.For reference, I'm comparing these to a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds that are a few years old. I think the sound and overall clarity on these may be better than the Samsungs, though it's also likely time to replace those. My main issue comes down to two things: The case and the touch controls.The case is a good size and weight and has good battery life. My issue is with the USB-C port placement: It's on the BOTTOM of the case. This means that it can't sit flat to open it and take out the earbuds. The Samsung Buds have the port on the back it sits flat facing you and you can easily open the top to remove or replace the earbuds. I feel like the port should've been relocated or the case redesigned on the Raycons.Second, the touch controls aren't great. Maybe I'm just too used to the Galaxy Buds and the companion app for use with my Samsung phone, but the Raycons seem slow to respond to single taps for volume, often causing me to either wait to see if the touch registered or tap multiple times not realizing that it did register earlier taps and I end up turning the volume up higher than I intended. On the Samsungs it's tap for play/pause, long tap/hold for volume increase/decrease, and double tap for skip forward. The small window they give you to double tap to play/pause on the Raycons is so small as to make the control pointless. 9 times out of 10 I just end up accidentally turning up the volume.That being said, I do think they're high quality earbuds, just with some questionable design choices. If I learn I'm using it wrong later I'll gladly update this review. For now I'm giving them 4 stars. Sound quality, isolation, and Awareness Mode are great. Could use some reworking when it comes to controls.","Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2024",AF7CQWTKJSA4FULYES5MYLNSU7VA,True,3,Color: Carbon Black
R2XUDVGDQKLJDU,B0CTD56NJ2,4.0 out of 5 stars My review,Chris,4,"Raycon everyday earbudsPROS-they are the first earbuds that feel like they won’t fall outthey also have good battery life and seem to charge fastThe natural noise cancellation is very good, I’m on a little but under medium volume but I can’t hear anything even in a room with a lot of people(restaurants,family events etc)The awareness mode is also a very good feature, and works well, of course it won’t fully work if you are blasting your ears but from slightly above medium and lower it seems to be very good, just don’t rely on it to muchThe price was very good, I got these for 60 dollars while usually they are 80 I believe, discounts are easy to find and they do a first order discount which is 20%, for the price these are better then my AirPods and originally I was going to use these as a backup but I think I’ll be using my AirPods as a backup instead.Final pro would be it’s easy to change volume with these, easy to switch songs and etc, manual is very easy to follow aswell.Cons-my first con would have to be the charger, it charges very quickly stated earlier but it very small in length. So expect to buy a longer one aswellReally the only other con I can think of if you can even call it that is the 3 different sound modes, they all sound pretty similar and they’re isn’t a huge noticeable difference, so if your expecting this feature to be a good feature then you would be disappointed but I mean the sound in general is great soConclusion-these earbuds are one of the best I’ve worn and I would definitely recommend, I’ll be seeing and updating this review if anything changes but I doubt it, all in all solid earbuds for a price that’s significantly cheaper then other high quality earbuds(Apple, beats etc)UPDATE-So I bought these in February, they still are pretty good besides the volume somewhat going down in the left one but I mean it has noise cancellation and I can hear nothing at the gym with both in and music playing, another somewhat issue is the left falls out a lot, that may be my ears but it is what it is, overall my opinion hasn’t changed to much she’s were and still are amazing earbuds for how cheap they are.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AE5AH4IPWHDU72VO55X4YCM3IOCQ,True,16,

I can have them in for hours and not feel any discomfort. The sound quality is pretty good. I used to have a pair of AirPods and the Raycon Everyday Earbuds are on par for the most part. Figuring out how to switch between modes can be a bit tricky because sometimes it will either change modes or raise/lower the volume depending on which one you touch. There was some stuttering when I connected it to my pc Bluetooth but it could also be an issue with my connector on the pc so I’ll have to test that out more. I did have the same issues with AirPods, though so take that with a grain of salt. I had them in when I worked out tonight and had no issues so overall I would say that these earbuds are pretty solid for the most part.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2024",AHGWLBN6262GHWMRYSJG7DY4WPZQ,True,1,Color: Royal Blue

I e heard good reviews about raycons, and decided to give them a try. I’m still learning to use the controls but it seems easy enough. The sound is clearer than skull candy and it impressed me enough to say I already like them. When I was using them on a phone call one person said I sounded a little muffled but it might have been the where I was using them. I will give an update after a few more days but I think at the price these are worth the money already. The case is wireless chargeable so that’s a plus and much smaller than the skullcandy ones I have. I am not sure of the charge just yet as I’ve only used these for 2 days.

I also like the color, case and battery life.Here are the consCon One.Like many manufacturers, they lie about fitting any ear. To do that you need different shapes and different depths, as well as different sizes and likely little hooks. I have earplugs that manage it and somehow basic earbuds can succeed, probably because they're light weight. A tapered oval shape works well.My ear canal is very small and I don't have a big enough space for the earbuds to actually rest within my outer ear. The only thing keeping them in is the silicon ear pieces, and they barely manage that. I can feel the working their way out and have to catch them, bringing me to my next con.Con 2. If your ear buds are constantly falling out, you're gonna touch them, and, if you do, you'll change the settings, the volume, etc, way too easily. One of mine fell in my bra and apparently skin contact was enough to have them cycle through settings as I frantically tried to fish them out. I don't like the volume going to max in my other earbud that I've managed to keep in.They have good sound but for me they're only usable at home, without me moving at all. The claim they fit any ear size is so false and pretty much any manufacturer has multiple ear piece sizes, so they really haven't even tried to match that claim.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AFTCEQST6F6TJ5S4WJXL56UZ4GFA,True,0,Color: Forrest Green

Now that I've tried them myself, I can confirm that the rumors are true and they really are just that good! The audio quality is flawless and the earbuds fit very snuggly in my ears and never feel tight or loose. The case is very small making it perfect to fit in my pocket. The whole case is glossy so it's intentionally difficult for the lid to get caught on something and open by accident. There's a small ""handle"" lip that's a more traditional non-glossy plastic you pull on instead.And instead of having an optional noise cancelling mode like some other wireless earbuds or headphones, noise cancelling is instead passively active at all times (barely even noticeable may I add) and the reverse is available: awareness mode. It simply enables microphones on each earbud to allow you to hear your surroundings better. Though simple, it's pretty ingenious. It's really nice to listen to my music by myself and then turn on awareness mode when somebody is in the room so I can hear them if they ask me something. At first glance the effects might seem minimal and it takes a second to get used to, but it works really well!Overall these are by far the best wireless earbuds I've ever purchased.

R37MS1VY24Y1IL,B0CTD56NJ2,4.0 out of 5 stars Music on a Motorcycle,Nathan,4,"I was on the lookout for earbuds that work underneath my helmet and without one. I found many a product such as the JLab and Samsung wireless earbuds or the Shure and MEE wired earbuds. I choose these earbuds because it was on sale, and had a red color that matched my helmet. My main concern before it arrived was if it’ll fall out my helmet in it or when I take it off. I had previously had AirPod Pros, but they would fall out easily while driving my motorcycle, maybe because the cushions weren’t the right size. Either way, I really hoped these would just stay in place and not fall out when I removed my helmet.When these arrived, I was decently surprised to find that these actually sealed and worked in comparison to my AirPod Pros. I even did a huge shake test running and jumping, and they didn’t fall out. Now, it was time to put it to the test by trying to put a helmet on and off, and hope it stays inside my ear. With putting it on, it actually stayed in and work perfectly fine, but on removal? It fell out my ears. I tried to keep it and pry the edges away from my ears any way I could, but to no avail. But then I tried on of my old helmets that fit me with a looser fit, and they actually stayed in on removal. I learned my helmet currently is a bit tight and that any earbud with that helmet would probably have trouble not coming out due my ear being pried every single time.Otherwise, it was time for the ultimate test: using it without a helmet. I was afraid the weight of it might drag it out, but actually, driving with them on felt pretty stable and I could still hear through them. The sound coming out was great and I didn’t need to have the music blaring. I ran it at about 70-80mph, and it stayed in. Any higher than that, and I don’t know to be quite honest.The awareness mode being off blocked out all the wind noise and sounded decent for noise cancellation. Great wind noise reduction, but not as great as the Pros, but not too loud such as… I don’t know… not wearing any ear protection? Only problem is keeping the awareness mode on actually amplifies wind noise which is a blaring issue and causes excessive noise. It becomes unbearable when outside and is deafening, even just trying to talk to others.Overall, great earbuds for everyday use like it claims while also fitting in my helmet (except on removal) and without a helmet. Only con is awareness mode on isn’t great outside.","Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2023",AEW6SU5XVHBZ2GP45QLUJIQ6WE4A,True,30,

R1Y3JNX3BK1S6W,B0CTD56NJ2,4.0 out of 5 stars I really wanted to like these Raycon headphones....,John Bartley,4,"When it comes to convenience, the small size of the Raycon headphones is a definite plus – they fit into any pocket without a hitch. Unfortunately, that's where the positivity ends.The sound quality, to put it mildly, is a letdown. It's a bizarre mix of tinny and muddy, as if the headphones are desperately trying to cover all bases and failing miserably. As an artist with a broad taste in music, these headphones didn't just fall short; they faceplanted.Whether I was diving into the intricate melodies of classical compositions or getting lost in the soulful beats of jazz, the Raycon headphones managed to make each genre sound equally subpar. It's like they have a vendetta against good sound.Now, if your playlist consists solely of top 40 hits and rap music, you might escape the full brunt of the disappointment. However, for anyone who appreciates the nuances of various genres, these headphones are akin to putting a masterpiece through a blender.In conclusion, while the pocket-sized design is nifty, the Raycon headphones are a sonic letdown. They seem tailor-made for the top 40 enthusiasts, but for those seeking a more refined auditory experience across different music genres, the search for the perfect pocket-friendly headphones continues.","Reviewed in the United States February 6, 2024",AHJLJE5P4M56RP2MRHJIT6QD4G7Q,True,7,

Not sure what happened there guess the Amazon driver dropped them off at the wrong place or got themselves some new ear buds.

This is pretty awesome considering most businesses do not do anything like this so props to them for looking out for their customers. I’ve been trying out Raycon’s Fitness Headphones and they’re great so far. Comfortable, good noise cancelling, and they stay pretty snug on my head while running.I’ve had these since early March now and I’ve put them through rigorous workouts, including running, so this is for people who intend to use them in the gym or on runs.PROS: they have withstand sweat so far and are light/compact. Relatively affordable price. Good battery life.CONS: the sound quality is kind of cheap sounding, especially the native action sounds it makes for clicking next, powering on, etc sound like they belong on earbuds that should be priced at $39.99 not the $80 something they ask for. The sound leaks quite a bit so you almost have to increase the volume pretty high to achieve that “noise cancelling” at the gym. Which sucks because I don’t want to damage my ear drums.

R1QAQEA3L8VCBJ,B0CLFXPYPC,5.0 out of 5 stars Shocked!!!,brian kachelman,5,"I just got these today and let me start of by saying.... DAMN!!! I was using Anker's Soundcore Life P3s for a CO pleasure years till they just got old and worn out. I loved those earbuds. During my search for the ""best earbuds with EQ app"" I came across these in a couple different Reddit threads and audiophile website reviews and comparisons. I was trying to decide between these and Sony WF-1000XM5s. I wanted a set of earbuds that has good bass but not muddy. Everyone was saying the Sony's were good for bass but muddy. Everyone was saying the 3ANC were damn good and cost less. I took the risk and got these. Well....Compared to any other earbuds I've ever had, these are absolutely the best! I'm very picky with my EQ settings and I tune to get my perfect soundscape. These earbuds with the Status app deliver everything I wanted and needed! Absolutely worth the price! I'd even pay more! I mean I was about to drop $300 USD on the Sony's. I am very happy with the options on the app to tune these. And they have 3 drivers! So the highs and mods don't get drowned out by bringing up the lower end of the frequencies up. The sound is powerful and amazing for earbuds! I love the modern look of these as well...If you're reading this to try and decide on a set of buds, I highly highly recommend these! I'm thinking about trying the over ear sets they have also. Just have to wait for next month (current date: 27 Feb 2024). The VA doesn't pay us veterans much to be able to splurge often. HahahahaOk, for the details...Music and calls are very precise and the sound is rich right out of the box.The call clarity is great! I called my GF to see how I sounded on her side of the call. (The call quality on the Soundcore buds was sub par mainly because of how old they were.) She told me she could hear me and understand me so much better compared to my old buds.I tested the sound with several different tone test tracks through YT music and damn... Let me tell you... These buds just hit you with excellent tonality! Lows areextremely rich and deep. Highs are crisp and beautiful. And the mids are right there and not washed out by the other tones.I then played some Nin Inch Nails, Mudvayne, The Crystal Method, and I can hear all the intricate sounds of the separate instruments and the voices came through so perfectly! (Y ah, I'm a metalhead \m/ lol)Watching YT vids was so much better compared to any other buds I've had.The set up is quick and easy. Just take them out of the charging case (which was already at 90% charge.) keep in mind there's protective film on the charging surfaces on the buds themselves. You have to take that off and let the buds charge up for a few minutes. I only had them in the case for maybe a minute to charge enough gh to pair them to my phone (Pixel 7 pro). I had no problem with that.The app is easy to navigate and a very welcome addition to the entire listening experience. It has toggles for ANC, and sound passthrough. The ANC is excellent. The sound passthrough is the best I've had on any buds. I was able to stay aware to my surroundings even better than I was expecting and without it sounding like it was being processed through a cheap mic and played back. It sounded very natural, and a bit amplified. Perfect for me.Get these!!! They're absolutely worth every penny!!!-Images are:Comparing Soundcore and Status Between 3ANC-Left are Soundcore-Right are Status Between 3ANC","Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2024",AGEEAH5UJ2CM7V46JRSMGV2XPLRA,True,30,Color: Onyx (Black)

No fitment issues or problems with them staying in my ear. Reasonably comfortable can be worn all day with no issues. Battery life is commendable, and charge time is very short for the buds themselves. Now with a couple of complaints... You cannot use the app to change sound profiles with just one earbud in use, you must have both out of the case. Also have had an issue with them charging when put in the case, only once, but it was inconvenient to try to put them in at the beginning of the day just to find out they were both at 10%. Also have had an issue with them beeping in the case, almost as if the mic and the speakers were interfering with each other and causing them to chirp repeatedly. Lastly, I wish they would incorporate a way to find the buds if they got lost. Already had a scare, but that is really my fault for just sticking it in my pocket and not in the case.

R17UUUSBZRJVUU,B0CLFXPYPC,5.0 out of 5 stars Hearing is believing,David H.,5,"I'll try to keep this from getting long winded, it would be easy to do. I don't have any of the ultra high end brands to compare to but I do have the Between Pros and I have compared them to more common options like standard Airpods, Airpod Pros and Galaxy Bud Pros and a lot of lesser cost options from Skullcandy, and I do have some higher end wired earbuds and these sound better than all of them, and the battery outlasts them all by a wide margin. The only device I have that even compares are some full size wireless headphones from Bowers and Wilkins, and I think those only outside the 3ANC's through deeper bass, I think the mids and highs are on par.Pros:Excellent battery life, I clocked nearly 13 hours of nonstop play with noice cancelling turned on at a low-medium volume. This may change depending on how loud you listen.Excellent fit. These buds use an inner silicone ring that comes in 3 sizes that hooks onto your ear, kinda hard to explain until you try them and figure out what fits your ear best. The end result is the buds don't really go IN your ear canals, they just cup snugly to them. I've never had one fall out and I wear them mostly for work.Completely unbranded. I actually misplaced these at work and they were lost for nearly a week, and I found them where I guess I left them laying. I guarantee you if anyone had known what they cost or how good they sound, they would have found a new home. I love how they're subtly designed and don't scream ""look at me I have the big name brand"".Excellent sound. Obviously this is somewhat subjective, and tuning through an EQ does make a difference, but they beat out every other wireless earbuds I've tried.Cons:The app is a bit lacking. It functions as it should, it gives you some control over EQ and three sound profiles and operates the noice cancelling and ambient sound options, but it takes too many screens to click through to get connected to the buds. This seems nitpicky but by comparison my Bowers and Wilkins headphones take one click. Its not a BAD app but I think it could be better.More for the Between Pros than the 3ANC, I had an issue where I'd put the buds back in the case and my music would keep playing, because one of the buds didn't ""register"" that it was in the case. I found that I had to wiggle it to get it to connect to the case and that would stop my music. I haven't had this happen with the 3ANC buds, and the case on these actually seems like they've made some improvements to the magnets and the lid hinge seems tighter and stays closed stronger.One big negative/warning that is more Amazon's fault than Status's, I received a used pair of these buds. The box still had gift wrap and tape damage on it and the earbuds had ear wax all over them. This is even the second time I've gotten used earbuds, I bought some Airpod Pros that were used and one bud was even missing.Also when these went on sale I had just bought them at full price 3 days prior. I contacted Status and they said they couldn't do a price adjustment, so I had to return and rebuy at the same price which was a bit of a hassle.Anyway, if you're serious about your music you need to at least give these a try, I do think they're at least worth the $199 sale price, but I also think every earbuds company is pushing their luck pricing them much higher than that.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2023",AERRGOFYY35OLWNMODZU5OOMQYNQ,True,60,Color: Onyx
R1HXEGJCS4J4RZ,B0CLFXPYPC,"3.0 out of 5 stars Phenomenal Hardware, not so phenomenal software",Nick,3,"I want to give this review a higher rating, but I just can't due to how frustrating the connectivity is for the Bluetooth. constantly disconnecting, or never wanting to disconnect after closing the case with the headphones inside. The app that it comes with is also fairly unreliable. While it does save your settings, it constantly disconnects from the headphones and you have to constantly repair it in order to change the settings. (The setting stay the way I set them after they disconnect, though, which isn't all that bad.)Now the hardware and sound itself is super good. The headphones feel solid, lightweight but not cheap feeling. The sound is amazing, super clear quality, and amazing bass and range. I listen to a lot of different music, from extreme noisy metal to soft ambient jazz that require closer listening, and the headphones sound awesome on both (of course after a little fidgeting with the equalizer that the app has but not much as some of the preset settings are not bad.) The touch controls took a little bit of getting used to and feel very sensitive but once you figure it out and are a bit careful it's rather handy. Same with the ambient sound and the noise cancelling. They're already pretty snug in my ear and block out a decent amount of sound, but the software noise cancellation is really strong. Can barely hear anything, though, while this is a little personal, it gives me a headache and feels like I'm wearing them underpressure with the noise cancellation on. The ambient sound is pretty neat and sounds natural. Though when, say you're outside walking and there's traffic, it does cancel out the super loud noises, so you're not hurting your ears but are still aware of things around you.I use these as my main headphones every where I go and the battery life is strong. I charge it for a few hours, and they'll last me two weeks of heavy use almost every day during the day. I use it at work, when I'm working out, sometimes use them as earplugs for concerts, and just casual every day use. They're great. But again, the software behind these headphones are atrocious and should really be worked on, and they'll certainly get an easy 5 stars as they're the best sounding Bluetooth headphones I've used in a long long time.","Reviewed in the United States April 15, 2024",AHOOTE6CQEO25Y4KRJAYBD6B5WDA,True,10,Color: Onyx (Black)
R2MDTGCKBT3MTK,B0CLFXPYPC,1.0 out of 5 stars I expected so much more.,Kay Romeo,1,"The media could not be loaded. These earbuds are WELL below my expectations. The way they boast about the dedicated drivers for bass, I expected to feel the base in my ears. The sound quality is as good as any other $200 earbuds I own. In terms of audio, they sound clear. If that's what you're looking for, then these are it for you. The audio is clear, but the bass just simply doesn't exist for me. I own several different pairs of earbuds and headphones. One of my favorite Bass Cannon headphones are the Skullcandy crushers. If you want bass that literally shakes your face, those headphones scratch that itch just right. I'm VERY picky with my music, audio quality, and bass. These headphones tick 1 out of 5 of my requirements to keep the earbuds. I wore these earbuds for a grand total of 2 minutes to try and test the Equalizer, the music, microphone quality and sound quality. The equalizer is whack. It makes the music sound super muffly. The bass doesn't exist. When you raise the bass, it drowns out the noise, lowers the audio quality, and makes it sound super muffly. I don't feel the bass at all, or even 'hear' from the bass. It just muffles the audio quality. The microphone is okay, I tested it by calling a friend. I was told my microphone sounded okay, but they can definitely tell I'm using earbuds because of the quality. I expected better with 6 microphones on these things. These earbuds get a little loud. But loudness doesn't = better bass or audio quality. I don't like these earbuds at all. For $250 I expected better. I only used the for a few minutes and I already placed a return shipment to get my money back. I don't like these earbuds at all. That's my honest opinion. Again, I'm VERY picky when it comes to audio with earbuds and headphones, and these just did not hit it for me. With all the Ads I kept getting with the dedicated subwoofer in these, I expected these to rattle themselves out my ears in some capacity. It did no such thing, and I'm very disappointed.**EDIT 6/19/2024*****Now they won't stop beeping when they're closed. You can literally hear my co-worker laughing in the background because of how ridiculous these earbuds are. These earbuds don't have a ""Find my earbuds"" function in the app or anywhere in the instructions that indicates that they will beep for any reason at all. So I got a faulty pair of earbuds and case. Extremely disappointed considering the $250 price tag on these, on top of the other issues I have with these not sounding as good as any other earbuds I own. 100000% returning these and never buying another pair ever again.","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2024",AGVCCUAW37XR7X5VACM5M3YV5VPQ,True,13,Color: Onyx (Black)
R36KTPJNAGDHHX,B0CLFXPYPC,5.0 out of 5 stars Best wireless earbuds I’ve owned!,Brannon K. Lauritzen,5,"I grabbed these on a lightning deal for $129.I’ve worked in sound and lighting for live performances for over 20 years, and I’m always on the lookout for new tech that pushes things to the next level. A few years back, I tried the Bragi Dash Pro wireless earbuds because they did just that. They were the first to combine balanced armature drivers, sound transparency and onboard storage for listening without the need for a Bluetooth source. Since they went out of production, I’ve been watching to see who next would come close to what they achieved. The Status Between 3ANC earbuds are very close. The hybrid design utilizing dynamic and balance armature drivers delivers excellent sound quality, and the sound transparency offers a smart option for listening while running in public or wanting to have a conversation without taking the earbuds out. Onboard storage would be nice, but Bluetooth technology has improved enough to make that less important with smart watches taking the place of iPods and smartphones as an audio source. I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable they were straight out of the box with the included silicone ear tips. I do, however, recommend using foam ear tips as shown in the pictures. They conform to the ear canal better than any silicone ear tip can, providing optimal environmental isolation and sound quality.Pros:Great app that allows you to tweak the EQ to your liking.Hybrid driver technology delivers amazing sound quality.Battery life is outstanding!Good design provides comfortable fit.They look cool!Cons:No onboard storageIncluded ear tips are good as far as silicone tips go, but they’re inferior to foam tips.Bottom line: At the $129 price point, you’d be hard pressed to find a better overall set of wireless earbuds. In build quality and sound quality, these things rival Bose and Sennheiser products at half the price. Grab a pair!

R1SU8BQFLR4L5F,B0CLFXPYPC,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great noise cancellation, but have weird issues with connectivity and charging.",Amazon Customer,3,"First of all, I saw an ad for these earbuds and liked the features promoted, and I had a discount on them plus points available from a credit card, so I was able to reduce the price from the already discounted $179.00 (down from $249.00) down to around $115. This was a GREAT deal and the primary reason I ended up buying them. The very first issue I encountered can be seen in the photo posted with this review. I am FAR from a technophobe and take pride in my tech knowledge and am generally able to handle just about every tech item there is. However, this little thing got me this time. NOWHERE in the documentation (as far as I can tell) mentions that there is a protective film over the charging points. I used the earbuds on the initial charge and when I put them in the charging case, they never charged, I tried everything I could think of. But the little plastic film never stuck out to me because it just looked like a different colored section of the earbud. After figuring out my dumb mistake, I have been able to get them charged. However, the left earbud has an issue getting charged. When I place both in the case the red charging light comes on both, but then the left goes off, and will only stay on if I press on the end closest to the hinge. Sometimes it just takes a small press and it works, but sometimes I keep having to open the case and press down on the earbud to get it to charge. Like right now, I just took both earbuds out of the case after more than 12 hours of charging to listen to music and the right earbud is charged 100% and the left was charged 5%, and after 10 minutes of listening, I got the ""Battery Low"" notification in my left ear. (BTW, has anyone pointed out how creepy it is that it's not like a robotic voice that gives you warnings or notifications, it's an actual guy talking in your ear? When you are resting or just listening to music and occupied with something else it can scare the wits out of you and make you think there's a guy right beside you...but that's probably just me). The charging issue will be the only reason I return or replace these if I decide to make that decision.As far as noise cancellation, these are fantastic!!! My old earbuds were the Sony WF-1000XM4's, and although they had great sound quality, they did not fit my ears very well. My ears stick out some and so they kind of pushed the Sony buds out of my ear, so the noise cancellation did not work very well. But the Between ANC's actually go farther into my ear and have the ""wings"" in addition to the ear pieces that fill in the outer area to block out extra noise. This is AMAZING!The other issue I have with these earbuds is the multi-point connectivity (Ability to connect to multiple devices at the same time). I generally use them when working on my Desktop PC, so they connect to that most of the time. But when I connect to my phone (which you HAVE to do to see any information about the buds or change any settings) to listen to music, and then turn off the music on my phone and close the music app, my phone still interacts with the buds. My phone is the Galaxy Fold 5, so I can open it to access the larger screen inside. If I'm watching movies/listening to music on the PC and using the earbuds with the PC, and then happen to open the phone, it pauses the movie/music on my PC, and if I close the phone again, the movie/music pauses again on my PC. Also, not only does it pause the movie, but if I press the right earbud to unpause the movie, it opens the music app on my phone and plays music. You literally have to go and control whatever device you want to use the earbuds with and then can use the buds to control it. But if you're watching a movie and get a text, and then try to pause the movie, it's going to open music on your phone instead of pausing the movie.It's nice to be able to connect to 2 devices, but they shouldn't interact with each other. It's very frustrating.Bottom line, as far as earbuds go, these are WELL worth the price and function very well as earbuds in terms of sound and noise cancellation. I must just have a defective case or earbud that prevents constant charging of one of the buds. I will probably be asking for a replacement, but I don't foresee that being an issue with many people.","Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2023",AHF4YE3XYIY2CDM2HRWWILRKYNBQ,True,16,Color: Onyx (Black)
R3VF7AOHYW6QGS,B0CLFXPYPC,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and comfort, poor controls and ANC",Miranda,4,"For context to my opinion on the sound of these buds, I previously owned a pair of airpod pros which I returned due to the sound being incredibly flat. I also tried out a pair of the technics AZ80s which had nice sound but were really sharp on the highs to the point that straight I couldn’t listen to some of my favorite songs. I also thought the AZ80s felt cheep, but the AirPods felt very nice quality.Pros:The sound on these things is great! The highs mids and lows come through extremely clear, and these are definitely the best earbuds I’ve owned for listening to music. This said, I like really bass heavy sound so you may need to use the equalizer.The fit on the 3ANC is also fantastic. For me personally, the AirPod pros would fall out of my ears and hurt when I smiled. Neither are a problem here with the sizing options, so I would really recommend for people who have had issues with ear size. I was also worried they would visually stick out of my ears, but they look quite nice all things considered.The physical quality of these is mid to high. Definitely not on the level of the AirPods, especially with how the touch controls handle, but not plastic feeling and light like the AZ80s. The metal exterior is nice to the touch so long as it’s not too cold outside.Cons:Going to go in a bit more detail here but it doesn’t mean the cons outweigh the pros.WHY IS THE CONTROL TO TURN UP THE SOUND PRESSING AND HOLDING THE RIGHT EARBUD? I honestly would have given these a five star rating had this been different. Let’s say I’m taking out my right earbud first to put it back in the case, and I close my hand around it. Suddenly the bud processes this as me turning up the volume, and shoots up so quickly it’s awful. Alternatively, let’s say it’s extremely cold outside and the metal exterior earbuds are getting cold in your ears. Should you cup your and around them, the volume again will shoot up exponentially. This would not be a problem if the app had the ability to change touch controls, but it does not.Compared to the AirPod pros, the ANC leaves a lot to be desired. I commute daily on a train, and the 3ANCs don’t block out a lot of the high pitched squeaking. They also have a little “hiss”, but it’s not that much of a problem for me.I get what they’re going for with the voice that says connected etc, but it sounds like a man whispering very close to my ears and I’m kind of creeped out about it. It’s a real person, which is cool, but I personally would probably prefer something that sounds like they’re speaking at normal volume.Finally, I still thought that really high pitch noises such as certain cymbal crashes and people saying a sharp “s” sound were weirdly loud (same problem with the az80s) but this may be a me issue. This problem isn’t too bad, though, and I messed with the equalizer to basically fix it.Overall:Overall, again I really like these buds. Much better purchase in my opinion than the AirPods or AZ80s, but I’m mostly using for music rather than calling.","Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2024",AHCVEICO2QTUJAZXUH3SXXCDXR5Q,True,23,Color: Bone (Off-White)

I currently also own the Sony Wf-1000Xm3 and the Apple AirPods Pro 2, but I have to say, this new pair gives them both a run for their money! They are exactly what I was looking for. The fact that their app provides an 8-band equalizer just helps you get the type of sound you were looking for; whether you like a strong bass, neat highs, or ALL combined, look no further. High/mid/low frequencies are all neatly managed due to their Advanced Triple Driver Technology so you can enjoy the sound of vocals and music to the highest quality level possible. As a lifelong musician, I don't like to settle for less-than-amazing sound quality, and this product does not disappoint at all. I got my pair yesterday, and fell asleep to the music of SAGA!

Noise cancelling has become a must for me, as I often prefer to listen to music while mowing or shredding weeds.Noise Cancelling is excellent. I noted 4/5 stars not for any fault in cancellation, but simply because Bose's QuietComfort and Samsung's Ear Buds Pro 2 outperform it by a slim but noticeable amount. There is sometimes some wind noise caught by the microphones while walking on a gustier day, but it's something you become accustomed to fairly quickly.Oddly enough it seemed like the buds needed some slight break-in for noise cancelling to work well.

R3CHI2X8O4KR69,B0CLFXPYPC,3.0 out of 5 stars Decent with Some Room for Improvement,Paul,3,"The Status Beyond 3ANC advertise audiophile sound quality, class leading noise cancellation, and transparency mode. They also include six microphones for enhanced call quality. These features can also be had for less than most competing products.While all this sounds well and good, it doesn’t necessarily mean much unless the earbuds deliver. Personally, I think they are quite good if you can get them for a substantial discount. If not, consider the mainstream competitors.Pro:+ Comfort. Despite their large size, the earbuds are light and comfortable. They are easy to adjust and stay in your ear without issue.+ EQ. App offers equalization adjustments on IOS and Android with noticeable effects on sound.+ Battery Life. 8 - 12 hours depending on ANC.+ Build Quality. The case and earbuds seem like they are well built.+ Connectivity. Bluetooth connectivity was flawless and connected to my pc and phone quickly every time.Neutral+- Sound. First of all, make sure you have the proper ear tips installed before assessing the sound on these. It can be deceiving if you really have a proper seal or not. Once you do, you’ll notice a really dynamic and clear sound signature. They’re impressive on first listen, but fairly fatiguing after that. The standard sound signatures are too bright for my taste, but you can attempt to eq it more to yours.+- Controls. Hybrid mix of physical and touch buttons. Fairly intuitive, but the physical buttons are small and touch controls are somewhat finicky (like most I’ve used).Cons- Noise Cancellation. While not terrible or the worst I’ve used, it was underwhelming to say the least. These are advertised to be class leading, but I find it hard to believe. I have other wired, non noise canceling earbuds, that have better noise isolation than these with noise canceling on. This works more effectively on low frequency noises than mid and high ones.- Transparency Mode. Initially I found this to be very effective and well implemented. Voices came through sounding natural and it made it a lot easier to hear your surroundings. The problem is that in quieter environments a significant amount of white noise is also added into the mix. This can make it really annoying to use in this use case.-Other Noises. During my time with these earbuds I’ve noticed more operational noises than with others. When pausing music you can hear a significant amount of white noise in the background. There also seems to be various desync issues with the buds where you can hear the delay temporarily between the two. Volume also seems to be wonky and is not consistent when adjusting up or down. This is something I’ve never experienced in any other product.- App. Simple, but a bit clunky to use. You need to reconnect your earbuds to the app each time you connect it to your device and it takes a bit of time to do so. I would have liked to see customization of the controls here and maybe more granular control of noise cancellation and transparency mode.- Call quality. I tested the call quality of these versus several other wireless earbuds and headphones I own and was disappointed. Once again, this was an advertising point for the product and the end result was underwhelming. Recordings sounded muffled and somewhat quiet. People on the other end of calls noted this as well and actually stated that earphones costing a sixth the retail cost sounded clearer.","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2024",AEZI2OLN43EHMUTO5VN3CVQNAYYA,True,5,Color: Onyx (Black)

R2LXQ6SYXSFXHV,B0CLFXPYPC,5.0 out of 5 stars Worth the investment,Binary Buddha,5,"This review is from someone that was able to distinguish the difference between MP3 VBR0 and 320 CBR conversions using Bose QC15 headphones. These are the best earbuds I've used. This review is based on using the Noise Cancelling function and the Audiophile sound profile in the IOS App.PROs: Wide frequency range response to various genres of music. Sharp and clean highs. Full mids. Sexy bass. Since most earbuds have issues with the bass I'll focus on that. The bass is quite a wide range with impressive response. Listening the synth/electro sustained/reverb bass it feels like your upper half of your body is vibrating with it. Or at the very least your head. It's not like you're standing in front of a sub-woofer. But, it's a whole lot better than any of the earbuds I've used. All three channels sound very full and complete being able to hear some sounds/frequencies that you don't normally hear in ""normal"" speakers/headsets/earbuds. The design of the earbuds is much more effective and affective. The charging contact points are; as far as I can tell, the farthest away from the ear plug. So, you don't have to worry about ear wax and skin oil creating issues with it when charging. Aside from the different sizes of earbuds, there's different sizes of ear ??channel?? fittings that help it be and feel more secure when you put it in your ear. The multi-point/source is also nice to be able to connect it to my phone and computer at the same time without having to unpair and pair it again and again.CONs: Needs to have some sort of way to attach it to zipper or keychain or something to keep from falling to bottom of my bag.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2024",AFEROJX6TB4PSMHSBZVZZSSTK3LQ,True,1,Color: Bone (Off-White)

RGVB1V6Z9YDOI,B0CLFXPYPC,3.0 out of 5 stars Sounds better than AirPods Pro BUT….,Unboxophile,3,"Cutting to the chase, the Status Between 3ANC immediately sounds SUPERIOR acoustically than my AirPods Pro (1st gen) … BUT the noise cancelling on the AirPods Pro is better than the Status in a couple of ways.Switching between Noise cancellation and Ambiance mode with the Status I had to toggle back and forth trying to compare what the difference was. In Ambiance mode (and no music), I could distinctly hear an artificial sound, like hearing “the ocean” when you put your ear up to a seashell. A little distracting. Whereas with the AirPods, you’ll know right away if noise cancellation is on and it’s almost as if you’re not wearing earbuds at all in ambiance mode.Lightly rubbing my palms together, it sounds like AirPods may have a slight edge on Status with noise cancellation. I’m also about to hop on a plane soon so that’ll be my ultimate test between the two. Right away tho, the tiny button on top of the Status to activate noise cancellation isn’t as accessible. I prefer the “pinch” on/off with AirPods.First Impressions: The first 30 mins from unboxing, trying to pair the Status has not been user-friendly with my iPhone (14 Pro Max). iPhone users are spoiled with how seamless other Apple products pair within their own ecosystem. I was expecting the same ease with Status. Not so much.My actual experience: Once I opened the Status case, my iPhone bluetooth did not detect it. Case definitely had power (3 light dots). So then I check the manual which reads “Open the case AND REMOVE THE EARBUDS.” Ok, so I remove the earbuds from the case. Still no bluetooth detection. I even waited 5-10 seconds as per manual suggests. Still nothing. I turn on and off my phones Bluetooth. No success. At this point I’m a little frustrated, half with Status and half with Apple for not being so friendly in the sandbox.I then noticed that there were these blue strips that covered the buds. Once removed, they lit up in the case indicating that they were charging. I took out the buds again, and it was then my iPhone detected it. It paired… then it disconnected!? I thought maybe the buds are totally drained? But no, the app indicated both buds had at least 75-80% battery life. Retoggled the phones bluetooth and it detected again. But what was weird is that the Between 3ANC shows up TWICE in my bluetooth devices. So I selected to forget the device and have it detected again.I know I’ve written a novel here and if you’re exhausted from reading, imagine how exhausted I feel with trying to pair these to the iPhone.If acoustics is the ONLY thing you care about, these are definitely more superior than AirPods. As of now, I’m on the fence about keeping these because of all of the other things I appreciated about AirPods I feel I’m trading off for.","Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2024",AEMYUSCIMPGMYYONA5OOKE4F7LGQ,True,6,Color: Bone (Off-White)

Former XM4 user review.,Justin Raymer,4,"These replaced my sabotaged Sony XM4s, which to be honest are just the greatest.After the sour taste Sony left me by rendering one earbud dead after an update, I went looking for another pair of earbuds. Like many off you, I was being bombarded by Status adds left and right, so I decided to give them a shot (the price was right).SO. After a few days off usage, how do they compare?SOUND - Awesome. Really really good. I was worried the triple driver was going to be a gimmicky thing, but its not. They sound awesome. PLAY AROUND with the presets and EQ. I do not like the first two presets at all, but the ""Original Between Pro"" seems to do just fine. The triple drivers really open up the sound. I'm not sure how to describe it, but the sound is not ""busy"". The range of tones and sounds is instantly noticeable. Vocals arent over ran by instruments, and vice a versa. You can hear them all and nothing is drowned out.ANC - right out of the box, I was super disappointed. The Sony XM4s are just soooo good at ANC. The ANC works, just not as good. My recliner sits right next to my AC return, and the Sonys would make it disappear. With these, its muffled, but still very noticeable. HOWEVER, I decided to mess around with the silicon tips and mid sections and WHAT A DIFFERENCE. I am currently using the smallest tip, with the middle size mid piece. This helped the ANC go from a 5/10 to an 8/10.FIT/COMFORT - See above. After swapping the silicone bits around, They feel fine. The adjustable mid pieces is an interesting feature. From out of the box, I went down one size on the tips, and up one on the mid piece. No loosey goosey here. They are snug and feel fine.Overall, If you are not after ANC, just get the non-ANC Betweens. The audio and listening experience is really good. I was hesitant to get them, and was just going to save up for some XM5's, but got impatient a bought these. I am not regretting the purchase, but I can tell you if I could buy a set of XM4s at the price I bought these.....

R2BAPL28L8A6QC,B0CLFXPYPC,3.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound quality but…,Ian,3,"These have amazing sound quality, the best sounding buds I’ve ever heard. Now for the criticism. I’ve been a AirPod pro user for years. Decided I wanted to try something different. A friend recommend these and gave me a quick audio test. I was instantly sold on the sound quality. But day to day use imo it is hard to beat AirPods. The noise canceling and ambient mode are far superior with AirPod pro compared to these. The buds feel like ear plugs when you are wearing them and when you are talking you sound muffled or at least I do to myself. The noise canceling does this weird back and forth sound thing whenever you are in a very loud environment and isn’t quite as good as the AirPod pros. The passive or transparent mode sucks. The microphone audio isolation doesn’t seem to be good either. Unless they are perfectly place in your ear and you are talking aren’t talking loud, people complain they can’t hear/understand me, even in a quiet room. Every now and then they do not pair immediately. Compared to the airpod case the case is kind of awkward shape in your pocket. Pairing is a pain. Randomly the button on each bud doesn’t work to change the sound mode. Really all they have going for them is superb audio quality.","Reviewed in the United States April 25, 2024",AEXOXXFRDWCYRYSJUBDE226W4R7A,True,0,Color: Onyx (Black)

I have owned TWS Sony, Bose Quiet Comfort, Samsung, and other known brand names to mention a few and none of them have compared to the sound stage of these headphones.They are good looking and discrete. Very functional and easy to set up and use. They are comfortable for my ear canals, which is a personal preference based on the size and shape of your ears.They may not be for some people, but I have found them to be more than acceptable when it comes to their performance. They have exceeded expectations, especially give the price point.The ANC could be improved but given the 3 driver sound quality and even the passive noise blocking with how they seal in the canal, the diminished ANC as compared to other ANC Earbuds like Bose is by far NOT a deal breaker. Everything else about these Earbuds more than makes up the difference in my opinion.As far as people showing pictures of breakage and claiming that they are cheaply made, I have to disagree. The quality is as good as any Brand Name TWS Earbud.I am extra careful with mine just like I am with my mobile phone. Awareness and care with this product just like any electronic product will extend it's life.If you are looking for a rugged do anything anywhere and treat them like an outdoor tool then these may not be for you.I have never had to deal with their customer service and have seen some poor reviews on Status' responses from customer inquiries.

R2SRSNE2V2CMEF,B0CLFXPYPC,"5.0 out of 5 stars Best earbuds I’ve tried, and I’ve tried a lot!",BodyMindSoul,5,"The problem with earbuds is that some will have a couple of good features and lack other features, while others have the missing features but lack the good features of the first. I purchased (and returned) *many* earbuds from Amazon, including the highest rated and among the most expensive, and was disappointed in all of them. These earbuds do it all, and do it all extremely well. I’ve had these less than a full week, and LOVE them:- True wireless Bluetooth connects instantly.- Full frequency range from deep bass to crisp highs.- Full EQ with ability to save settings. The bass is so deep on these, that if you max out the bass in the EQ, there will be TOO much bass. I’ve never heard that before on any earbuds, so if you like deep, rich bass when the music requires it, you won’t be disappointed.- Battery life: I can’t address this fully because once you charge the earbuds (and the case itself) the earbuds return to 100% after you snap them back into the case. I use these mostly in the gym but look forward to testing them on a long travel day sometime. All said, certainly they will last for days of normal use.- Noise cancelling: I’ve bought high-end noise cancelling headphones for years and won’t fly a plane without them, so I know what to expect. These are outstanding. Most of it is the technology, but an important part is the fit in the ear. They supply six pair of soft adapters so you WILL get the perfect fit. And I workout in the gym and sweat and they don’t slip or fall out. I may have to press in an earbud now and then, but not often.- Appearance: I was a little concerned that they might stick out and look a bit weird, but they don’t. The fact is, they fit deeply INTO your ear and the external piece nearly lays flat against your ear.- Controls: They’re simple and relatively intuitive. In fact, some controls are just automatic. When you take them from the case, they turn on and link in via Bluetooth automatically. And when you take them out and put them in the case, they turn off and unlink again. Sounds simple and obvious, but earbuds I own don’t do that at all.There is no downside to these other than price, but you get what you pay for with these. Longevity is the only unknown factor at this point. In an audio device world full of hype and false promises, these deliver on all levels.(P.S. For the record, I do not know anyone in this company and I’m posting this simply as a user to help others find what they’re looking for).","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2023",AFQ2RGZROMVAPWITCA6Z7UURWCTQ,True,87,Color: Onyx

The sound quality is beautiful. The eq is incredible. It’s just the Bluetooth connection is terrible. The earbuds never auto connect to my phone. They rarely disconnect from my phone when I put them back into the case. They will at times just start cutting out every other second and not fix themselves. I read other reviews like this and I just assumed they were overreacting and that the wonderful sound quality would far outweigh the negatives. But it unfortunately doesn’t. When I buy a brand new High Quality pair of earbuds I not only want amazing sound quality, but also user friendly and easy Bluetooth connection to my phone.

R27CTC0MJT4YKG,B0CLFXPYPC,3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound at a cost,Noah,3,"I feel very split on these. First ofall, the sound quality is the best I've heard in a small ear pod. Having come from the Google Pixel Buds Pro, there is simply more room to the sound, and the range is audibly better. The battery life is great too, and I never had them die on me.However thats about where my praise ends. The case feels cheap, the formfactor of the bud annoying, the app abysmal to use, and, in my experience, the noise cancelling was quite bad. Perhaps it was the seal in my ear, but I live in NYC and I could hear conversations quite clearly on the subway, no matter which silicone ear-piece I used. A problem I never experienced with my Pixel buds. The audio controls were also quite clunky, and the sound effect for pause/play and skip was quite harsh and plays at a constant volume. The formfactor of the buds also made them quite annoying if you want to wear a hood, or perhaps take off a hoodie or a mask once you get inside somewhere. They would inevitably snag on cloth of anything I removed from my person.Overall, they're not lying about the sound quality being great. But the tradeoffs in everything else led me to return them, especially given that the Pixel buds pro just went on sale for $130. Google's bud's slightly stuffed audio is instantly forgotten as soon as I'm not thinking about the bud in my ear at every other interaction.","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2024",AH6NIURMKO6EZ3FNXAELRUFI57AQ,True,0,Color: Onyx (Black)

Not because they’re terrible but because I knew exactly what I wanted from earbuds.Pros.Just as advertised; the sound quality is definitely the best I’ve heard in earbuds. The highs and mids are great the lows could probably use some more lows lol but overall great sound quality.ConsThe ANC is in my opinion… terrible. For me things sounded more muffled than cancelled (if that makes any sense) and there was a hissing sound that if you weren’t playing music at medium-low volume, would be noticeable. Unless you get used to it I guess… Same goes for the “transparency mode” there’s a slight hissing sound. It annoyed the hell out of me tbh.I would rather spend the extra $20ish or so on some AirPods Pros. Sometimes they go for $180… so that’s what I did.

I have to say, other than the noise cancellation not being quite as good, these headphones still deserve a lot of praise.In some songs, the audio quality is the same as the Sony buds, but in others you definitely get more detail. I have no complaints there since the Sony buds were the nicest ones I've used until these.My only software or firmware suggestions for Status would be:An option to change the in-ear notifications from the voice they picked to something like soft beeps.Definitely would love to see the ability to auto-pause when one or both buds are removed from your ear(s).I also find it difficult to get the touch controls to work, double tapping to skip songs usually ends up pausing. I'd like the option to disable or customize/assign key functions to the physical buttons on the top and, would end up avoiding the touch altogether.Also, the ANC is pretty good, but for the size of the headphones I was hoping for the same level as my Sony's. I prefer more discreet buds as well, these having the quality they do probably required the noticeable size, but that's OK. Still worth it.Overall, I'd still highly recommend these earbuds. If the nitpicks I personally have don't bother you, go for them, especially if you catch a good sale.Update 01/20/2024: I still love these. Using the ""original between pro"" sound mode (there are 3 and you can also create a custom EQ) I still regularly find songs where hear pieces of detail I cannot hear in my Sony buds, no matter how hard I try.

RUN6SMZB26EUJ,B0CLFXPYPC,"2.0 out of 5 stars Wanted to love them, but these earbuds were missing too many features for the price",Sarah,2,"My daily earbuds have always been Samsung, and although the sound quality isn't the best I found it easiest to connect and customize with my Samsung phones. I've had my eye on Status Audio devices, but the lack of ANC for their earbuds steered me away until these Between ANCs.Upon initial use, they weren't that comfortable and I could feel a slight difference in weight against my ear especially since these stick out of my ear a lot more than my Galaxy buds. Once I got the right combination of ear tip and ""wing"", it was better but the weight was still noticeable though nothing too bad. Sound wise, they deliver a more full and punchier sound than Samsung. The app allows you to customize the EQ to your liking and you can hear the slightest change thanks to the triple driver. The earbuds are able to drown out outside noise better even at lower volume due to the earbud fit and ANC. The ambient noise feature works very well with the 6 mics and I hear outside noise a lot more clear than other earbuds. I haven't been able to fully test out phone call quality. Battery life hasn't been a problem for me. I like having a physical button and it's easy to press. Also, the touch controls are less sensitive than my Samsung buds which I like since my hair doesn't accidentally activate a touch control.Unfortunately that's all the pros that stand out to me. For the price of $250, I don't think just good sound quality and ANC make this a good buy. It's missing features such as being able to customize buttons, adjust ambient sound levels, and auto pause audio when removing the earbuds from your ears. Although you can use just one earbud at a time, depending on which side of earbud you use you won't be able to skip or replay a song because that control is on the other earbud since only the left can rewind and the right can skip. The Bluetooth connection is so weak. I was washing my car and left my phone about 15 feet away with no walls between us and the earbuds kept cutting out just by walking to the end of my tiny car. I've never had this issue with my Galaxy buds, as I could walk pretty much upstairs while leaving my phone downstairs and the connection would stay. The build quality doesn't feel like $200. They came out of my ear during my workout and fell onto my wooden floor and the metal part of the earbud has a dent.I really wanted to like these earbuds and keep them, but they're missing features that fit my needs when using earbuds which don't justify the price for me. I'd pay $150 max for these and I still think that's really pushing it since the lack of features and the amount of little annoyances it brings you would probably not make this my daily earbuds. If you ONLY care about sound quality and EQ customization and price is no issue, this would be a great earbud for you. Unfortunately these are going to be returned.Update:So I ended up returning them and I found out my friend also bought them recently. They unboxed it with me and I realized that the one I bought here on Amazon was used because mine didn't have the shrink-wrap covering the box nor the blue stickers on the bottom of each earbud to prevent them from charging in the case before being open.

The “original between Pro” was my favorite of the 3. Definitely a cleaner sound and a heavy low end. But what really makes the difference is being able to make your own eq curve. I got to adjust the eq to my liking and it sounds phenomenal. I do believe it does need some work though, the noise canceling and transparency modes are decent. Not like the Apple AirPods. It definitely gets the job done but I think the AirPods are just a little better in that category. With that being said, I’d still choose these headphones over the AirPods simply because of the customizable EQ curve and the triple drivers makes this a monster.I would definitely recommend!","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AF7S4LB734FSBQMTGZ7UP3UXX7FQ,True,14,Color: Bone (Off-White)

R1QO0PW8Y7OP2Z,B0CLFXPYPC,2.0 out of 5 stars Made cheaply,glebb,2,"I bought the Between Pros before and they were fantastic. Unfortunately I lost them and they don’t have tracking like AirPods.Bought these thinking they were going to be even better. But unfortunately they were worse than 1st gen AirPods. I don’t doubt they were engineered well since I loved my Between Pros, but the sound quality was poor and they sounded really tinny and far away. No warmth, very digital sounding. Even messing with the EQ. My guess is lazy cheap manufacturing from China is the cause. I understand they need a low price point to compete, but you can’t advertise both low price and good sound, cause one is in opposition of the other.I returned my buds and use my 1st gen AirPods because although they may not have as wide of a space for audio, they are comfier are less complicated and sound decent. Where as with these I was always wondering whether or not I was doing something wrong.Anyways maybe roll the dice. Maybe I got a bad pair. I’m not an audiophile so it’s hard to tell. But since I’m not an audiophile, I shouldn’t have noticed the tinny sound quality if they were made well. But I don’t really have trust in this company to buy them again. I liked the Between Pros though.Another point, you can tell they were made cheaply since they ALWAYS cut in and out randomly for a split second. It happens every while of listening time or so. I had the same experience with the between pros. However with the Pros I took it with less seriousness cause they weren’t expensive and sounded really good.It reminds me of the movie “Blackberry” where the guy behind the phone in the beginning of the movie hated the idea of his product being mass manufactured by Chinese engineers who didn’t really care. He could tell it was cheaply made by a little buzz in the circuit board. Then by the end of the movie the phone he released to compete with Apples iPhone was made cheaply with Chinese engineering and he could hear that little buzz.I get that same “good design poor execution” or maybe even backsliding on manufacturing morals with this product. Obviously I don’t know the CEO but maybe instead of trying to spend all your money on advertising and mass producing the competitor to Apples AirPods, maybe focus on each individual pair. I liked the Between Pros but I don’t want to buy those again since if I lose them they’re gone.

R2KVOSCB4LVU8G,B0CLFXPYPC,3.0 out of 5 stars As an engineer...,Ethan mccorkledieken,3,"I love these. I compared them DIRECTLY to apple Airpods and these made them sound like a $5 speaker. I use these for mixing and hearing protection while working events and they do great. However the build quality is lacking. You can tell these were designed by audio engineers and not technicians. The tap control pads are very very sensitive and I accidently hit it all the time when switching the noise canceling. And the the noise canceling button just doesn't work sometimes and I have to click it 2 3 times for it to tell me battery level until it starts working again. The app us also very slow and the equalizer is nowhere near perfect. It'd be 5 stars if the build quality and app was a little bit more robust but for $250 I can't ignore the mechanical and UI flaws. But if you're looking for absolute perfect, immersive sound, then these are the only earbuds you should look at. I'm still very happy with these despite 3 stars, I just think these things could've been very avoidable with more care beyond just this amazing tripple driver sound.","Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AHOHWNHA67RISQDZADOCG24IG7RA,True,0,Color: Onyx (Black)

I've been looking for replacement tips that would work, but can't seem to find the right size.

I have to say, these earbuds are pretty much everything I wanted them to be. The sound quality is easily on par with some of the studio reference earphones I have from AKG. Distortion is low, even at high volumes, and all the fine details of my music collection are coming through crystal clear. The fit of the earbuds, for me, is incredible. They feel like they were made for *my* ears, but I have read that not everyone has had that experience. So far the battery life seems to far exceed that of the Samsung Galaxy Pro buds I was using. The active noise canceling is almost too good. I could always have conversations with my old buds in, with these, I don't even hear someone yelling at me from 5 feet away. Could be good or bad depending on your situation.The only thing holding this review back from being 5 stars is that the control app they put out for these earbuds is pretty lackluster. It's perfectly functional in that it does what it's supposed to and doesn't crash, but it would be nice to see more customization and features from Status Audio in the future.

The 10mm dynamic driver offers incredibly DEEP bass & sub-bass, while the two balanced armature drivers for the mids and highs offer crisp DETAILED sound that absolutely deliver. I even compared these to my $400 Hifiman Edition XS open-back planar-magnetic over-ear headphones, and I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the two, aside from the XS having a bit wider soundstage.

Snug fit with light weight when fitted properly.Cons: 1. Stick out when worn properly, protruding too far out not good. 2. Software app on phone turns on and off and doesn’t connect automatically when placed in ear, you must restart and reconnect to app. 3.

If your phone is in your pocket, you cannot activate “hey Siri.” In addition to that, the noise canceling in louder environments gets overwhelmed from time to time and the person on the other side of the phone has trouble hearing your voice. The earbuds also doesn’t have a “find my” feature for emitting a sound such as AirPod gen 2 does. So for me, I will have to give it to AirPods overall.

I have a couple sets of high end audiophile grade headphones that sound absolutely incredible, and these are not that. I switched to these as my wireless ear buds from the Anker Soundcore liberty pro 3s. The reason I switched is because the liberties have a very hard time with their charger for people in the trades and mine just wouldn't consistently charge and it was very VERY annoying. HOWEVER the soundcore headphones are probably the best sounding earbuds on the market and at their price point they're honestly unbeatable for audio quality. Liberty pro 3 ANC is a joke though. They're terrible for noise cancelation. As far as noise cancelation the Status ear buds are actually quite nice though. I had to do a significant EQ adjustment to the status headphones to get them to sound decent. At first they're very very plasticy and very lacking in timbre. They're bright and tinny. Drums don't sound good, vocals sound plasticy and everything is a little harsh. After EQ and enough listening time to get used to their sound I went up to 3 stars from initially wanting to give them 1 star. If you're buying these for their sound quality cause of the marketing of this Headphone, you're gonna be really disappointed I would assume, but the ANC is really good, and their charger hasn't been finicky at all yet and the battery life is really impressive. They're probably closer to a 2.5/5 but I'll be generous cause they at least work when I want them to.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2023",AHYO3KQJMWFLF4XTD77QJF75IR4A,True,8,Color: Onyx

I already have high quality headphones that I can’t use anymore because of that. Overall to the average ear these are good (I can tolerate them) the best way I can explain it they are too wide but not full. They are clear don’t get me wrong they are just missing something in between center and far left and right. I would say they are not exiting like my se846. They just don’t get me dancing when listening to Michael Jackson like my shures do. I can’t really compare them to my audio technica msr7 (also around $250 and have an active noise canceling pair) being that those are over ear headphones but they do sound way better than the between pros. I guess I should have known when they compare to beats, skullcandy, apple, Bose and Sony (which they are better than) but when it comes to products like sennheiser, audio-technica and Shure they just are not going to compare. If the anc worked right I would keep them","Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2023",AHLEPOFO5YSNPWXHUE7MB7MI63SQ,True,11,Color: Onyx
R377U3ZM314KUQ,B0CLFXPYPC,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic sound and connectivity,jeremy,5,"I had one of the first sets of wireless earbuds before Apple, had an awful exp with connectivity till AirPods. Then I lost my AirPods and figured they cost the same and seen ads I’ll give it a shot. They connect better than AirPods do to more than just the phone.Sound quality big difference to all in earbuds and sound better than $500 beats, and comparable to senhiser hd1.So far my draw backs are the app connectivity is lacking, the recipient on phone calls said it sounds like I’m on speaker sometimes. And they kinda stick out so they could get stuck on things during activity.Overall recommend and would get again","Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2024",AHAJGMYWVYDLKAG5WL46APNTRNFA,True,0,Color: Onyx (Black)
R27FRPEKKRGQGV,B0CLFXPYPC,4.0 out of 5 stars Sounds great. But…..,mtt,4,"I ended up returning mine.Do they sound good - yes!First off you either love or hate the look of these. They feel solid built. Battery lasts awhile compared to others. Sounds better than others.I don’t like:-the fitment .-They feel bulky, weird, stick out too much-no functionality compared to air pods on iPhone users-constant Facebook ads of how good they are(when they actually aren’t) this one is the most annoying-price!Some will agree with me, some won’t. But this is my honest opinion, I wish I would have liked them more but I will have to stick to air pods, or jabra for now just based on fitment or functionality alone, because that’s what I’m looking for.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2023",AFH4ANC455RPE4C5HNLZLI4NSMQA,True,3,Color: Onyx
R3I2EO9QI0B7OZ,B0CLFXPYPC,3.0 out of 5 stars Underwhelming,tucker goodwin,3,"I live in headphones and was extremely excited about these but was just genuinely not as impressed as I thought I would be they're not terrible headphones they sound decent but they're not the amazing headphones there claimed to be the quality headphones once again, just don't get too worked up and excited sound quality on my buds 2 Pro are definitely better, they don't support any losses codex, no Google Assistant nor Siri and the sound quality is barely more than mediocre granted they haven't been burnt in yet this is just my initial interpretation on day two highly considering returning","Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2024",AFA4ARZGPYKOEUYNQ5366Q4MUDAA,True,0,Color: Bone (Off-White)
R1Y3EEFZ6LRPH9,B0CLFXPYPC,5.0 out of 5 stars AMAZING SOUND! Much easier to get buds out of case than Between Pro.,Vinnie Da Arm,5,"I had been waiting for these to go on sale since they were released. Just couldn't afford the full price. Just got them last week and WOW. I had the Between Pros before and was always amazed how the sounded vs. other brands (even the supposedly premium brands). But I had an incredibly hard time getting the ear buds out of the case.These new 3ANC sounds so good too and are so much easier to remove from the charging case. Like life changingly easier. Battery life is good, size feels good. It's nice to have the extra tips as one of my ear canals is bigger than the other. They stay put most of the time, yet I still wish there was an optional overear hook for these like aftermarket ones for Apple ear buds.","Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2023",AHLOZGHBRZAFVI7IKH724I46TZKQ,True,2,Color: Onyx (Black)
